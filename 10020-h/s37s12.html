      <h2><a id="ch37-12" name="ch37-12"></a>Handcuffs.</h2>
      <h4>WRITTEN AND ILLUSTRATED BY INSPECTOR MAURICE MOSER,</h4>
      <h4><i>Late of the Criminal Investigation Department, Great Scotland Yard.</i></h4>
      <p>The ordinary connection of ideas between handcuffs and policemen does not need
      very acute mental powers to grasp, but there is a further connection, a
      philological one, which is only evident at first sight to those who have made a
      small acquaintance with the science of words.</p>
      <p>The word "handcuff" is a popular corruption of the Anglo-Saxon "handcop,"
      <i>i.e.</i>, that which "cops" or "catches" the hands.</p>
      <p>Now, one of the most common of the many slang expressions used by their special
      enemies towards the police is "Copper"&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, he who cops the offending
      member. Strange as it may seem, handcuffs are by no means the invention of these
      times, which insist on making the life of a prisoner so devoid of the picturesque
      and romantic.</p>
      <p>We must go back, past the dark ages, past the stirring times of Greek and Roman
      antiquity, till we come to those blissful mythological ages when every tree and
      every stream was the home of some kindly god.</p>
      <p>In those olden days there dwelt in the Carpathian Sea a wily old deity, known by
      the name of Proteus, possessing the gift of prophecy, the fruits of which he
      selfishly denied to mankind.</p>
      <p>Even if those who wished to consult him were so fortunate as to find him, all
      their efforts to force him to exert his gifts of prophecy were useless, for he was
      endowed with the power of changing himself into all things, and he eluded their
      grasp by becoming a flame of fire or a drop of water. There was one thing, however,
      against which all the miracles of Proteus were of no avail, and of this
      Arist&aelig;us was aware.</p>
      <p>So Arist&aelig;us came, as Virgil tells us, from a distant land to consult the
      famous prophet. He found him on the sea-shore among his seals, basking in the
      afternoon sun. Quick as thought he fitted handcuffs on him, and all struggles and
      devices were now of no avail. Such was then the efficacy of handcuffs even on the
      persons of the immortal gods.</p>
      <p>Having established this remote and honourable antiquity, we are not surprised at
      the appearance of handcuffs in the fourth century B.C., when the soldiers of a
      conquering Greek army found among the baggage of the routed Carthaginians several
      chariots full of handcuffs, which had been held ready in confident anticipation of
      a great victory and a multitude of prisoners.</p>
      <p>The nearest approach to a mention that we find after that is in the Book of
      Psalms: "To bind their kings in chains and their nobles in fetters of iron." But in
      the Greek, the Latin, Wickliffe's, and Anglo-Saxon Bible we invariably find a word
      of which handcuffs is the only real translation. It is also interesting to note
      that in the Anglo-Saxon version the kings are bound in "footcops" and the nobles in
      "handcops."</p>
      <p>In the early Saxon times, therefore, we find our instrument is familiar to all
      and in general use, as it has continued to be to this day. But during the fifteenth
      and sixteenth centuries there is no instance of the use of the word "handcop"; its
      place is taken by "swivel manacle" and "shackbolt," the latter word being often
      used by Elizabethan authors.</p>
      <p>Handcuffs, like other things, have improved with time. Up to 1850 there were two
      kinds in general use in England. One of the forms, most common in the earlier part
      of this century, went under the name of the "Figure 8." This instrument does not
      allow the prisoner even that small amount of liberty which is granted by its modern
      counterpart. It was chiefly used for refractory prisoners who resorted to violence,
      for it had the advantage of keeping the hands in a fixed position, either before or
      on the back of the body. The pain it inflicted made it partake of the nature of a
      punishment rather than merely a preventive against resistance or attack. It was a
      punishment, too, which was universally dreaded by prisoners of all kinds, for there
      is no more unbearable pain than that of having a limb immovably confined.</p>

         NO. 1.&mdash;THE "FLEXIBLE."</p>
      </div>
      <p>The other kind of form known as the "Flexible" (No. 1) resembled in general
      outlines the handcuffs used every day by detectives.</p>
      <p>Contrivances, chiefly the result of American ingenuity, for the rapid and
      effectual securing of prisoners have not been wanting, and among them the "Snap,"
      the "Nippers" (No. 3) and the "Twister" must be mentioned.</p>

         NO. 3.&mdash;"NIPPERS."</p>
      </div>
      <div style="float:right; width:40%; clear:right;">

        src="images/095-4.jpg" alt="" /></a><br />
         NO. 4.&mdash;THE "TWISTER"</p>
      </div>
      <p>The "Snap" (No. 2) is the one which used to be the most approved of. It consists
      of two loops, of which the smaller is slipped on the wrists of the person to be
      arrested, the bars are then closed with a snap, and the larger loop is held by the
      officer. The manner in which the "Twister" (No. 4) was used savours very much of
      the brutal, and, indeed, the injuries it inflicted on those who were misguided
      enough to struggle when in its grasp caused its abolition in Great Britain.</p>
      <p>Its simplicity and its efficacy, together with the cruelty, have recommended it
      for use in those wild parts of South America where the upholder of the laws
      literally travels with his life in his hands. It consists of a chain with handles
      at each end; the chain is put round the wrists, the handles brought together and
      twisted round until the chain grips firmly. The torture inflicted by inhuman or
      inconsiderate officers can easily be imagined. When we see the comparative facility
      with which the detective slips the handcuffs on the villain in the last act of
      Adelphi dramas, we are apt to be misled as to the difficulty which police officers
      meet with in the execution of one of the most arduous parts of their duty.</p>
      <p>The English hand-cuffs (No. 1) are heavy, unwieldy, awkward machines, which at
      the best of times, and under the most favourable circumstances, are extremely
      difficult of application. They weigh over a pound, and have to be unlocked with a
      key in a manner not greatly differing from the operation of winding up the average
      eight-day clock, and fastened on to the prisoner's wrists, how, the fates and good
      luck only know. This lengthy, difficult, and particularly disagreeable operation,
      with a prisoner struggling and fighting, is to a degree almost incredible. The
      prisoner practically has to be overpowered or to submit before he can be finally
      and certainly secured.</p>
      <p>Even when handcuffed, we present to a clever and muscular ruffian one of the
      most formidable weapons of offence he could possibly possess, as he can, and
      frequently does, inflict the deadliest blows upon his captor. Another great
      drawback is the fact that these handcuffs do not fit all wrists, and often the
      officer is nonplussed by having a pair of handcuffs which are too small or too
      large; and when the latter is the case, and the prisoner gets the "bracelets" in
      his hands instead of on his wrists, he is then in possession of a knuckle-duster
      from which the bravest would not care to receive a blow.</p>
      <p>On the occasion of my arresting one of the Russian rouble note forgers, a
      ruffian who would not hesitate to stick at anything, I had provided myself with
      several sized pairs of handcuffs, and it was not until I had obtained the very much
      needed assistance that I was able to find the suitable "darbies" for his wrists. We
      managed to force him into a four-wheeler to take him to the police-station, when he
      again renewed his efforts and savagely attacked me, lifting his ironed wrists and
      bringing them down heavily on my head, completely crushing my bowler hat.</p>

         NO. 5&mdash;"AMERICAN HANDCUFF" (OPEN).</p>

         NO. 6&mdash;"AMERICAN HANDCUFF" (CLOSED).</p>
      </div>
      <p>As the English handcuffs have only been formed for criminals who submitted
      quietly to necessity, it was considered expedient to find an instrument applicable
      to all cases. The perfected article comes from America (Nos. 5 and 6), and, being
      lighter, less clumsy, and more easily concealed, finds general favour among the
      officers at Scotland Yard. In fact, such are its advantages that we must presume
      that it differs considerably from the Anglo-Saxon "Hand-cop" and the somewhat
      primitive article used upon the unwilling prophet of the Carpathian Sea. This and
      the older kind, to which some of the more conservative of our detectives still
      adhere, are the only handcuffs used in England.</p>
      <div style="float:left; width:50%; clear:left;">

         No. 7&mdash;"LA LIGOTE."</p>
      </div>
      <p>The ingenious detective of France, where crime and all its appurtenances have
      reached such a state of perfection, is not without his means of securing his man
      (No. 7). It is called "La Ligote" or "Le Cabriolet." There are two kinds: one is
      composed of several steel piano strings, and the other of whip-cords twined
      together, and they are used much in the same way as the "Twister."</p>
      <p>Any attempt to escape is quickly ended by the pain to which the officer who
      holds the instrument can inflict by a mere turn of his hand. One wrist only is
      under control, but as the slightest sign of a struggle is met by an infliction of
      torture, the French system is more effective than the English.</p>

         No. 9.&mdash;"LA POUCETTE."</p>
      </div>
      <p>The Mexican handcuff (Nos. 8 and 9) is a cumbersome and awkward article, quite
      worthy of the retrograde country of its origin.</p>
      <div style="float:left; width:40%; clear:both;">
        <p class="figure"><a href="images/097-3.jpg"><img width="100%"
        src="images/097-3.jpg" alt="" /></a><br />
         NO. 10.&mdash;"LA CORDE."</p>
      </div>
      <div style="float:left; width:40%;">
        <p class="figure"><a href="images/097-4.jpg"><img width="100%"
        src="images/097-4.jpg" alt="" /></a><br />
         NO. 11.&mdash;"MENOTTE DOUBLE."</p>
      </div>
      <p>No. 10 shows an effective method of handcuffing in emergencies. The officer
      takes a piece of whipcord and makes a double running knot: he ties one noose round
      the wrist of the prisoner, whose hand is then placed in his trousers pocket, the
      cord is lashed round the body like a belt, and brought back and slipped through the
      noose again. The prisoner when thus secured suffers no inconvenience as long as he
      leaves his hand in his pocket, but any attempt to remove it would cause a deal of
      suffering.</p>
      <p>No. 11 is another handcuff of foreign make, and is merely used when a raid is
      about to be made, as it allows to a certain extent the use of the hands. It is
      useful for prisoners who are being conveyed by sea.</p>
      <div style="float:left; width:40%; clear:both;">
        <p class="figure"><a href="images/098-1.jpg"><img width="100%"
        src="images/098-1.jpg" alt="" /></a><br />
         NO. 12.&mdash;"EASTERN HANDCUFF."</p>
      </div>
      <p>No. 12 is mostly used in Eastern Europe.</p>
      <p>My personal experience of handcuffs is small, because I dislike them, for in
      addition to their clumsiness, I know that when I have laid my hands upon my man, it
      will be difficult for him to escape.</p>
      <p>My intimate knowledge of all kinds of criminals in all kinds of plights
      justifies me in saying that when they see the game is up they do not attempt
      resistance. The only trouble I have had has been with desperadoes and old
      offenders, men who have once tasted prison-life and have a horror of returning to
      captivity.</p>
      <p>Expert thieves have been known to open handcuffs without a key, by means of
      knocking the part containing the spring on a stone or hard substance. It will be
      remembered that when the notorious criminal "Charles Peace" was being taken to
      London by train, he contrived, although handcuffed, to make his escape through the
      carriage window. When he was captured it was noticed that he had freed one of his
      hands.</p>
      <p>I was once bringing from Leith an Austrian sailor who was charged with ripping
      open his mate, and as I considered that I had a disagreeable character to deal
      with, I handcuffed him. Naturally, he found the confinement irksome, and on our
      journey he repeatedly implored me to take them off promising that he would make no
      attempt to escape. The sincerity of his manner touched me and I released him, very
      fortunately for myself, for I was taken ill before reaching London, and, strange as
      it may appear, was nursed most tenderly by the man who had ripped a fellow
      mate.</p>
      <p>In Belgium the use of handcuffs by police officers is entirely forbidden.
      Prisoners are handcuffed only on being brought before the <i>Juge d'Instruction</i>
      or <i>Procureur du Roi</i>, and when crossing from court to court. Women are never
      handcuffed in England, but on the Continent it is not an uncommon occurrence.</p>
      <p>Regarding handcuffs generally, in my opinion not one of the inventions I have
      mentioned now in use is sufficiently easy of application. What every officer in the
      detective force feels he wants is a light, portable instrument by means of which he
      can unaided secure his man, however cunning and however powerful he may be. I
      myself suggest an application which would grip the criminal tightly across the
      back, imprisoning the arms just above the elbow joints. Such an instrument would
      cause him no unnecessary pain, while relieving officers from that part of their
      duty which is particularly obnoxious to them, viz., having a prolonged struggle
      with low and savage ruffians.</p>
      <p>I cannot refrain from relating a piquant little anecdote told to me by a French
      colleague, who had occasion to make an arrest, and came unexpectedly on his man.
      Unfortunately he was unprovided with handcuffs and was somewhat at a disadvantage,
      but being a quick-witted fellow, he bethought himself of an effectual expedient.
      Taking out his knife he severed the prisoner's buttons which were attached to his
      braces, thus giving the man occupation for his hands and preventing a rapid flight.
      I am indebted to M. Goron, Chief of the Detective Department in Paris, and other
      colleagues for some of the specimens here reproduced by me.</p>

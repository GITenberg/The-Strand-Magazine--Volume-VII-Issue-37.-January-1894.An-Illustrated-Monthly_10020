      <p>"But, uncle&mdash;I love my cousin!"</p>
      <p>"Get out!"</p>
      <p>"Give her to me."</p>
      <p>"Don't bother me!"</p>
      <p>"It will be my death!"</p>
      <p>"Nonsense! you'll console yourself with some other girl."</p>
      <p>"Pray&mdash;"</p>
      <p>My uncle, whose back had been towards me, whirled round, his face red to
      bursting, and brought his closed fist down upon the counter with a heavy thump.</p>
      <p>"Never!" he cried; "never: Do you hear what I say?"</p>
      <p>And as I looked at him beseechingly and with joined hands, he went
      on:&mdash;</p>
      <p>"A pretty husband you look like!&mdash;without a sou, and dreaming of going into
      housekeeping! A nice mess I should make of it, by giving you my daughter! It's no
      use your insisting. You know that when I have said 'No,' nothing under the sun can
      make me say 'Yes'!"</p>
      <p>I ceased to make any further appeal. I knew my uncle&mdash;about as headstrong
      an old fellow as could be found in a day's search. I contented myself with giving
      vent to a deep sigh, and then went on with the furbishing of a big, double-handed
      sword, rusty from point to hilt.</p>
      <p>This memorable conversation took place, in fact, in the shop of my maternal
      uncle, a well-known dealer in antiquities and <i>objets d'art</i>, No. 53, Rue des
      Claquettes, at the sign of the "Maltese Cross"&mdash;a perfect museum of
      curiosities.</p>
      <p>The walls were hung with Marseilles and old Rouen china, facing ancient
      cuirasses, sabres, and muskets, and picture frames; below these were ranged old
      cabinets, coffers of all sorts, and statues of saints, one-armed or one-legged for
      the most part and dilapidated as to their gilding; then, here and there, in glass
      cases, hermetically closed and locked, there were knick-knacks in infinite
      variety&mdash;lachrymatories, tiny urns, rings, precious stones, fragments of
      marble, bracelets, crosses, necklaces, medals, and miniature ivory statuettes, the
      yellow tints of which, in the sun, took momentarily a flesh-like transparency.</p>
      <p>Time out of mind the shop had belonged to the Cornuberts. It passed regularly
      from father to son, and my uncle&mdash;his neighbours said&mdash;could not but be
      the possessor of a nice little fortune. Held in esteem by all, a Municipal
      Councillor, impressed by the importance and gravity of his office, short, fat,
      highly choleric and headstrong, but at bottom not in the least degree an unkind
      sort of man&mdash;such was my uncle Cornubert, my only living male relative, who,
      as soon as I left school, had elevated me to the dignity of chief and only clerk
      and shopman of the "Maltese Cross."</p>
      <p>But my uncle was not only a dealer in antiquities and a Municipal Councillor, he
      was yet more, and above all, the father of my cousin Rose, with whom I was
      naturally in love.</p>
      <p>To come back to the point at which I digressed.</p>
      <p>Without paying any attention to the sighs which exhaled from my bosom while
      scouring the rust from my long, two-handed sword, my uncle, magnifying glass in
      hand, was engaged in the examination of a lot of medals which he had purchased that
      morning. Suddenly he raised his head; five o'clock was striking.</p>
      <p>"The Council!" he cried.</p>
      <p>When my uncle pronounced that august word, it made a mouthful; for a pin, he
      would have saluted it bare-headed. But, this time, after a moment's consideration,
      he tapped his forehead and added, in a tone of supreme relief:&mdash;</p>
      <p>"No, the sitting does not take place before to-morrow&mdash;and I am forgetting
      that I have to go to the railway station to get the consignment of which I was
      advised this morning."</p>
      <p>Rising from his seat, and laying down his glass, he called out:&mdash;</p>
      <p>"Rose, give me my cane and hat!"</p>
      <p>Then, turning towards me, he added, in a lowered tone and speaking very
      quickly:&mdash;</p>
      <p>"As to you&mdash;don't forget our conversation. If you think you can make me say
      'yes,' try!&mdash;but I don't think you'll succeed. Meanwhile, not a word to Rose,
      or, by Saint Barth&eacute;lemy, my patron of happy memory, I'll instantly kick you
      out of doors!"</p>
      <div style="float:left; width: 40%;">

         "AT THAT MOMENT ROSE APPEARED."</p>
      </div>
      <p>At that moment Rose appeared with my uncle's cane and hat, which she handed to
      him. He kissed her on the forehead; then, giving me a last but eloquent look,
      hurried from the shop.</p>
      <p>I went on scouring my double-handed sword. Rose came quietly towards me.</p>
      <p>"What is the matter with my father?" she asked; "he seems to be angry with
      you."</p>
      <p>I looked at her&mdash;her eyes were so black, her look so kind, her mouth so
      rosy, and her teeth so white that I told her all&mdash;my love, my suit to her
      father, and his rough refusal. I could not help it&mdash;after all, it was
      <i>his</i> fault! He was not there: I determined to brave his anger. Besides, there
      is nobody like timid persons for displaying courage under certain
      circumstances.</p>
      <p>My cousin said nothing; she only held down her eyes&mdash;while her cheeks were
      as red as those of cherries in May.</p>
      <p>I checked myself.</p>
      <p>"Are you angry with me?" I asked, tremblingly. "Are you angry with me,
      Rose?"</p>
      <p>She held out to me her hand. On that, my heart seething with audacity, my head
      on fire, I cried:&mdash;</p>
      <p>"Rose&mdash;I swear it! I will be your husband!" And as she shook her head and
      looked at me sadly, I added: "Oh! I well know that my uncle is self-willed, but I
      will be more self-willed still; and, since he must be forced to say 'yes,' I will
      force him to say it!"</p>
      <p>"But how?" asked Rose.</p>
      <p>Ah! how? That was exactly the difficulty. But, no matter; I would find a way to
      surmount it!</p>
      <p>At that moment a heavy step resounded in the street. Instinctively we moved away
      from each other; I returned to my double-handed sword, and Rose, to keep herself in
      countenance, set to dusting, with a corner of her apron, a little statuette in its
      faded red velvet case.</p>
      <p>My uncle entered. Surprised at finding us together, he stopped short and looked
      sharply at us, from one to the other.</p>
      <p>We each of us went on rubbing without raising our heads.</p>
      <p>"Here, take this," said my uncle, handing me a bulky parcel from under his arm.
      "A splendid purchase, you'll see."</p>
      <p>The subject did not interest me in the least.</p>
      <p>I opened the parcel, and from the enveloping paper emerged a steel
      helmet&mdash;but not an ordinary helmet, oh, no!&mdash;a superb, a monumental
      morion, with gorget and pointed visor of strange form. The visor was raised, and I
      tried to discover what prevented it from being lowered.</p>
      <p>"It will not go down&mdash;the hinges have got out of order," said my uncle;
      "but it's a superb piece, and, when it has been thoroughly cleaned and touched up,
      will look well&mdash;that shall be your to-morrow's job."</p>
      <p>"Very good, uncle," I murmured, not daring to raise my eyes to his.</p>
      <p>That night, on reaching my room, I at once went to bed. I was eager to be alone
      and able to think at my ease. Night brings counsel, it is said; and I had great
      need that the proverb should prove true. But, after lying awake for an hour without
      receiving any assistance, I fell off to sleep, and, till next morning, did nothing
      but dream the oddest dreams. I saw Rose on her way to church in a strange bridal
      costume, a 14th-century cap, three feet high, on her head, but looking prettier
      than ever; then suddenly the scene changed to moonlight, in which innumerable
      helmets and pieces of old china were dancing a wild farandola, while my uncle, clad
      in complete armour and with a formidable halberd in his hand, conducted the
      bewildering whirl.</p>
      <p class="figure"><a href="images/043-1.png"><img width="90%"
      src="images/043-1.png" alt="" /></a><br />
       "MY UNCLE SAT SMOKING HIS PIPE AND WATCHING ME."</p>
      <p>The next day&mdash;ah, the next day!&mdash;I was no nearer. In vain, with
      clenched teeth, I scoured the immense helmet brought by my uncle the previous
      evening&mdash;scoured it with such fury as almost to break the iron; not an idea
      came to me. The helmet shone like a sun: my uncle sat smoking his pipe and watching
      me; but I could think of nothing, of no way of forcing him to give me his
      daughter.</p>
      <p>At three o'clock Rose went into the country, whence she was not to return until
      dinner-time, in the evening. On the threshold she could only make a sign to me with
      her hand; my uncle had not left us alone for a single instant. He was not easy in
      his mind; I could see that by his face. No doubt he had not forgotten our
      conversation of the previous evening.</p>
      <p>I went on rubbing at my helmet.</p>
      <p>"You have made it quite bright enough&mdash;put it down," said my uncle.</p>
      <p>I put it down. The storm was gathering: I could not do better than allow it to
      blow over.</p>
      <p>But suddenly, as if overtaken by a strange fancy, my uncle took up the enormous
      morion and turned and examined it on all sides.</p>
      <p>"A handsome piece of armour, there is no doubt about it; but it must have
      weighed pretty heavily on its wearer's shoulders," he muttered; and, urged by I
      know not what demon, he clapped it on his head and latched the gorget-piece about
      his neck.</p>
      <p>Struck almost speechless, I watched what he was doing&mdash;thinking only how
      ugly he looked.</p>
      <p>Suddenly there was a sharp sound&mdash;as if a spring had
      snapped&mdash;and&mdash;crack!&mdash;down fell the visor; and there was my uncle,
      with his head in an iron cage, gesticulating and swearing like a pagan!</p>
      <p>I could contain myself no longer, and burst into a roar of laughter; for my
      uncle, stumpy, fat, and rubicund, presented an irresistibly comic appearance.</p>
      <div style="float:left; width: 60%;">
        <p class="figure"><a href="images/044-1.png"><img width="100%"
        src="images/044-1.png" alt="" /></a><br />
         "THREATENINGLY HE CAME TOWARDS ME."</p>
      </div>
      <p>Threateningly, he came towards me.</p>
      <p>"The hinges!&mdash;the hinges, fool!" he yelled.</p>
      <p>I could not see his face, but I felt that it was red to bursting.</p>
      <p>"When you have done laughing, idiot!" he cried.</p>
      <p>But the helmet swayed so oddly on his shoulders, his voice came from out it in
      such strange tones, that the more he gesticulated, the more he yelled and
      threatened me, the louder I laughed.</p>
      <p>At that moment the clock of the H&ocirc;tel-de-Ville, striking five, was
      heard.</p>
      <p>"The Municipal Council!" murmured my uncle, in a stifled voice. "Quick! help me
      off with this beast of a machine! We'll settle our business afterwards!"</p>
      <p>But, suddenly likewise, an idea&mdash;a wild, extraordinary idea&mdash;came into
      my head; but then, whoever is madder than a lover? Besides, I had no choice of
      means.</p>
      <p>"No!" I replied.</p>
      <p>My uncle fell back two paces in terror&mdash;and again the enormous helmet
      wobbled on his shoulders.</p>
      <p>"No," I repeated, firmly, "I'll not help you out, unless you give me the hand of
      my cousin Rose!"</p>
      <p>From the depths of the strangely elongated visor came, not an angry exclamation,
      but a veritable roar. I had "done it!"&mdash;I had burned my ships!</p>
      <p>"If you do not consent to do what I ask of you," I added, "not only will I not
      help you off with your helmet, but I will call in all your neighbours, and then go
      and find the Municipal Council!"</p>
      <p>"You'll end your days on the scaffold!" cried my uncle.</p>
      <p>"The hand of Rose!" I repeated. "You told me that it would only be by force that
      you would be made to say 'yes'&mdash;say it, or I will call in the neighbours!"</p>
      <p>The clock was still striking; my uncle raised his arms as if to curse me.</p>
      <p>"Decide at once," I cried, "somebody is coming!"</p>
      <p>"Well, then&mdash;yes!" murmured my uncle. "But make haste!"</p>
      <p>"On your word of honour?"</p>
      <p>"On my word of honour!"</p>
      <p>The visor gave way, the gorget-piece also, and my uncle's head issued from
      durance, red as a poppy.</p>
      <p>Just in time. The chemist at the corner, a colleague in the Municipal Council,
      entered the shop.</p>
      <p>"Are you coming?" he asked; "they will be beginning the business without
      us."</p>
      <p>"I'm coming," replied my uncle.</p>
      <p>And without looking at me, he took up his hat and cane and hurried out.</p>
      <p>The next moment all my hopes had vanished. My uncle would surely not forgive
      me.</p>
      <p>At dinner-time I took my place at table on his right hand in low spirits, ate
      little, and said nothing.</p>
      <p>"It will come with the dessert," I thought.</p>
      <p>Rose looked at me, and I avoided meeting her eyes. As I had expected, the
      dessert over, my uncle lit his pipe, raised his head, and then&mdash;</p>
      <p>"Rose&mdash;come here!"</p>
      <p>Rose went to him.</p>
      <p>"Do you know what that fellow there asked me to do, yesterday?"</p>
      <p>I trembled like a leaf, and Rose did the same.</p>
      <p class="figure" style="clear:both;"><a href="images/045-1.png"><img width="90%"
      src="images/045-1.png" alt="" /></a><br />
       "DO YOU LOVE HIM?"</p>
      <p>"To give him your hand," he added. "Do you love him?"</p>
      <p>Rose cast down her eyes.</p>
      <p>"Very well," continued my uncle; "on this side, the case is complete. Come here,
      you."</p>
      <p>I approached him.</p>
      <p>"Here I am, uncle," and, in a whisper. I added quickly: "Forgive me!"</p>
      <p>He burst into a hearty laugh.</p>
      <p>"Marry her, then, donkey&mdash;since you love her, and I give her to you!"</p>
      <p>"Ah!&mdash;uncle!"</p>
      <p>"Ah!&mdash;dear papa!"</p>
      <p>And Rose and I threw ourselves into his arms.</p>
      <p>"Very good! very good!" he cried, wiping his eyes. "Be happy, that's all I
      ask."</p>
      <p>And, in turn, he whispered in my ear:&mdash;</p>
      <p>"I should have given her to you all the same, you big goose; but&mdash;keep the
      story of the helmet between us two!"</p>
      <p>I give you my word that I have never told it but to Rose, my dear little wife.
      And, if ever you pass along the Rue des Claquettes, No. 53, at the place of honour
      in the old shop, I'll show you my uncle's helmet, which we would never sell.</p>

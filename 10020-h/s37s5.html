      <p>Reference was made at the close of the last article to the voice of the dog, and
      his method of making his feelings and desires understood. It is, of course, well
      known that this is an acquired habit, or accomplishment. In a state of Nature the
      dog does not even bark; he has acquired the art or knowledge from his companionship
      with man. Isaiah compares the blind watchman of Israel to dogs, saying, "They are
      dumb; they cannot bark." Again, to quote the argument of Dr. Gardiner: "The dog
      indicates his different feelings by different tones." The following is his yelp
      when his foot is trod upon.</p>

       DOG YELPING.</p>
      <p>Haydn introduces the bark of a dog into the scherzo in his 38th quartette.
      Indeed, the tones of the "voice" of the dog are so marked, that more than any other
      of the voices of Nature they have been utilized in music. The merest tyro in the
      study of dog language can readily distinguish between the bark of joy&mdash;the
      "deep-mouthed welcome as we draw near home," as Byron put it&mdash;and the angry
      snarl, the yelp of pain, or the accents of fear. Indeed, according to an assertion
      in the "Library of Entertaining Knowledge," the horse knows from the bark of a dog
      when he may expect an attack on his heels. Gardiner suggests that it would be worth
      while to study the language of the dog. Perhaps Professor Garnier, when he has
      reduced the language of the monkey to "A, B, C," might feel inclined to take up the
      matter.</p>

      <p>Next to the dog there is no animal in which there is more variation of sound
      than in oxen: "Their lowing, though rough and rude, is music to the farmer's ear
      save one who moans the loss of her sportive young; with wandering eye and anxious
      look she grieves the livelong day." It is specially difficult in the case of oxen
      to suppose that they have a language; but it is impossible to doubt that the
      variations of their lowing are understood of one another, and serve to express
      their feelings if not their thoughts.</p>

       THE OX.</p>

      <p>In the matter of exclamations, one knows how readily these may be imitated upon
      the violin, or in the case of the deeper or more guttural sounds, on the
      violoncello. The natural effect is greatly aided by the sliding of the finger along
      the note, especially in the case of the lowing of cattle; but there are other
      exclamations that are readily reduced to music. Gardiner gives one or two
      interesting cases, and the common salutation, "How d'ye do?" may be instanced. It
      usually starts on B natural, and the voice rising to D ends on C; whereas, the
      reply, "Pretty well, thank you," begins on D, and falling to A, ends again on D.
      After a few attempts on the piano, the reader will be able readily to form these
      notes for himself.</p>

      <p>The horse, on the other hand, is rarely heard, and, though having a piercing
      whinny which passes through every semitone of the scale, it is scarcely ever
      varied.</p>

      <p>The music of the insects has already been alluded to, and everyone will agree
      with Gilbert White that "not undelightful is the ceaseless hum, to him who musing
      walks at noon." The entomologist has laboured hard to show us that the insect has
      no voice, and that the "drowsy hum" is made by the wings; a fact which, being
      beyond all cavil, puts to the blush the old-world story of Plutarch, who tells us
      that when Terpander was playing upon the lyre, at the Olympic games, and had
      enraptured his audience to the highest pitch of enthusiasm a string of his
      instrument broke, and a <i>cicada</i> or grasshopper perched on the bridge supplied
      by its voice the loss of the string and saved the fame of the musician. To this day
      in Surinam the Dutch call them lyre-players. If there is any truth in the story,
      the grasshopper then had powers far in advance of his degenerated descendants; for
      now the grasshopper&mdash;like the cricket&mdash;has a chirp consisting of three
      notes in rhythm, always forming a triplet in the key of B.</p>

       FLY BUZZING.</p>
      <div style="float:right; width: 50%; clear:both;">

      <p>Gardiner, on the authority of Dr. Primatt, states that, to produce the sound it
      makes, the house-fly must make 320 vibrations of its wings in a second; or nearly
      20,000 if it continues on the wing a minute. The sound is invariably on the note F
      in the first space. The music of a duck's note is given in the annexed score.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, an article on the music of Nature would not be complete without
      an allusion to the music of the winds and the storm. Admirers of Beethoven will
      recall numerous passages that would serve as illustrations. One particularly might
      be mentioned&mdash;the chorus in "Judah" (Haydn), "The Lord devoureth them all,"
      which is admirably imitative of the reverberations of the cataract and the
      thundering of mighty waters. The sounds at sea, ominous of shipwreck, will also
      occur to the minds of some. At Land's End it is not uncommon for storms to be
      heralded by weird sounds; and in the northern seas sailors, always a superstitious
      race of people, used to be much alarmed by a singular musical effect, which is now
      well known to be caused by nothing more fearsome than a whale breathing.</p>

       DUCK.</p>
      <p>These instances might be still further multiplied, but enough have, perhaps,
      been given to excite some general interest in "the <i>Music of Nature</i>."</p>

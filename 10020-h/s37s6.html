      <p>Sir Henry Brougham Loch, G.C.M.G., K.C.B., whose name has recently been so
      prominently before the public in connection with the disturbances in Mashonaland,
      is Chief Commissioner at the Cape. In his diplomatic career he was taken prisoner
      during the war with China; and, with Mr. Boulby, the <i>Times</i> correspondent,
      was carried about in a cage by his captors, and exhibited to the natives. After his
      liberation he returned to England, and was appointed Governor of the Isle of Man,
      and subsequently Governor of Victoria; and, in 1889, was appointed to succeed Sir
      Hercules Robinson as Chief Commissioner at the Cape.</p>

      <p>It was in Jubilee Year that the British public were first charmed by the singing
      of this admirable American contralto. She sang in London, and successive audiences
      were quick to confirm the judgments of Sir Joseph Barnby and certain other critics
      who had heard her only in private. Her advance to the front rank of English singers
      was exceedingly rapid, and her position amongst us was long since made secure.
      Madame Cole has taken part in nearly all the great musical events in this country
      during the past four years. She has sung everywhere in London&mdash;with the Royal
      Choral Society at the Albert Hall, at the Handel Festival at the Crystal Palace, at
      the Ballad Concerts, at the Monday Popular Concerts, at Sir Charles Hall&eacute;'s
      Concerts, and at Bristol, Chester, Leeds, Birmingham, and other leading towns. As
      seems to have been the case with most well-dowered musicians, Madame Cole's talent
      owes something to heredity. Musical ability, greater or less, may at all events be
      traced back in her family for a considerable period. Madame Cole's first distinct
      success in public was gained with Mr. Theodore Thomas, during that gentleman's
      first "grand transcontinental tour from ocean to ocean" in 1883.</p>

      <p>Robert James Loyd-Lindsay, K.C.B., V.C. is the eldest son of the late
      Lieut.-General James Lindsay. He was educated at Eton, and at an early age entered
      the Army. He served in the Guinea, 1854-5, part of the time as <i>Aide-de-Camp</i>
      to the Commander in-Chief. At the battle of Alma, amidst great disorder, he
      reformed the line and stood firm with the colours. At Inkerman he distinguished
      himself by charging and repulsing a strong body of Russians with a few men; for
      which distinctions he was justly awarded the Victoria Cross. Lord Wantage was
      Equerry to the Prince of Wales, 1858-9; and has been Extra Equerry to His Royal
      Highness since 1874. He is also the Lord Lieutenant and a County Councillor of
      Berkshire. He married, in 1858, Harriet Sarah, only child of the first Baron
      Overstone.</p>

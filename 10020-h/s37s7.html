      <h2><a id="ch37-7" name="ch37-7"></a>A Terrible New Year's Eve.</h2>
      <h4>BY KATHLEEN HUDDLESTON.</h4>
      <p>In a little Belgian village not many miles from Brussels the winter sun shone
      brightly. It shone through the quaint old windows of a little, red-tiled cottage,
      and on the figure of a girl who stood in the centre of the kitchen reading a long,
      closely written letter. Over the blazing fire, where the "pot au feu" was
      simmering, bent an old woman, and the girl's voice came joyously to her as she
      stirred the savoury mess.</p>
      <div style="float: right; width: 50%;">

         "MY AUNT, PAUL HAS SENT FOR ME."</p>
      </div>
      <p>"My aunt, Paul has sent for me. At last he has got permanent work. It is nothing
      very great at present, but it may lead to better things, and the pay is enough,
      with what he has saved, to enable him to rent a little 'appartement.' If I can, he
      wants me, with our little Pierre, to catch the coach at 'Les Trois Fr&egrave;res'
      to-morrow. We should then reach Brussels by night and spend our New Year
      together."</p>
      <p>As Babette spoke, her cheeks all flushed with hope and joy, the eyes of both the
      women rested on a cradle that stood in the room. In this, baby Pierre, only a
      twelvemonth old, lay sleeping peacefully.</p>
      <p>Then said the old woman, sadly, "I shall miss you, dearest, and the baby too.
      Still, it is only right you should go. Perhaps in the summer you may return for a
      bit. Time passes quickly. A year ago you were weeping over Paul's departure; and
      now, behold, you are going to join him, and lay in his arms the son he has never
      seen."</p>
      <p>Babette nodded. She was between tears and smiles. There was grief, true and
      deep, at leaving the dear old aunt, who had been so good to her and to her child.
      There was joy at the thought of seeing again the brave young husband whom she had
      wedded in the little village church two years before, and from whom the parting had
      been so bitter, when he left her, just before the birth of their baby boy, to seek
      work in the Belgian capital.</p>
      <p>But there was no time to waste. After the simple mid-day meal there were many
      things to be done, and all through the short winter day they were busy. There was a
      bundle of warm wraps to be put together for Babette to take with her. Her little
      trunk, with Pierre's cradle, and some odds and ends of furniture, would follow in a
      few days, when her aunt had collected and packed them all. Her little store of
      money was counted over. Alas! it was very slender. She must travel quickly and
      cheaply if it was to last her till she reached Brussels.</p>
      <p>"Jean's cart will take you as far as 'Les Trois Fr&egrave;res,'" said the old
      lady, cheerfully, after finding that counting the little heap of francs and
      half-francs over and over did not increase them. "That will save something. You can
      catch the coach that stops there at two, and by six you will be in Brussels. I pray
      the little one may not take cold."</p>
      <p>Babette agreed to all her aunt suggested. Jean was a farmer of the village;
      well-to-do and good-natured. She knew he would gladly give her a seat in his
      waggon, which was going next day to "Les Trois Fr&egrave;res," an inn six miles
      from the village. The coach for Brussels stopped there twice a week, and when once
      she had taken her place in it, the worst of her journey would be over.</p>
      <p>They went to rest early that night, and by eleven next morning the last good-bye
      had been said. Pretty Babette was seated by the side of Farmer Jean, with her baby
      boy, wrapped up in numerous shawls, clasped tightly to her, and the great Flemish
      horses were plodding, slowly but surely, towards "Les Trois Fr&egrave;res".</p>
      <p>The day was not as bright as the preceding one. Snow had fallen during the
      night, and the sky looked heavy, as though there were more to come. Babette
      shivered, in spite of her long, warm cloak. The roads were freezing hard, but they
      managed to proceed for a mile or two, and then suddenly there came a sway and a
      lurch, for one of the horses had slipped and fallen on the snowy road, and the
      other was trying to free himself from his struggling companion by frantic kicks and
      plunges.</p>
      <p>Farmer Jean had a man with him, and between them they got the poor animal up,
      while Babette stood in the cold highway, her baby peeping wonderingly from the
      folds of her cloak.</p>
      <p>The horse was bruised and cut about the knees, but otherwise unhurt, so the men
      resumed their places; Babette climbed back to hers, and the heavy cart went jolting
      on. The farmer cracked his whip, and whenever the road grew worse he or his man got
      down and led the horses. In spite of this, their progress grew slower and
      slower.</p>
      <p>"I don't like to say so," said the master, "but we've two more miles to go, and
      it is past one o'clock now. My girl, if the coach is gone, I'll get you back and
      drive you in again next time it passes."</p>
      <p>But Babette would not hear of this. Not to see Paul by nightfall! Not to be
      clasped in his arms, she and little Pierre together, in one warm embrace! Not to
      spend New Year's Day with him! No! she would not think of it. And yet when, more
      than an hour later, they rolled into the yard of "Les Trois Fr&egrave;res," there
      was no sign of the Brussels coach. It had started half an hour before. "Les Trois
      Fr&egrave;res" was a quiet, homely inn, little used excepting when the coach
      stopped there. Babette, pale and trembling, got down and ran into the bar, where
      the landlord stood smiling behind a row of bright pewter taps.</p>
      <p>"Am I too late for the coach?" she cried. "Has it gone?" And then, when the man
      told her she was indeed too late, all strength and energy left her, and she sank
      sobbing on the wooden bench by the door.</p>
      <p>There were two other men in the room, who looked at her curiously; she was such
      a pretty girl, even in the midst of her grief. One was an old pedlar, with his
      well-filled pack on the floor beside him. He had a pleasant, homely face, and thin,
      bent figure. The other was a middle-sized, powerful fellow, clean shaven and
      beetle-browed, and dressed in shabby, ill-fitting garments. It was hard to tell
      what his rank in life might be. He stared once again at Babette, and then handed
      his glass to the host to be re-filled. The pedlar was the first to break the
      silence.</p>
      <p class="figure" style="clear:both;"><a href="images/056-1.jpg"><img width="90%"
      src="images/056-1.jpg" alt="" /></a><br />
       "'CHEER UP, MY LASS', HE SAID KINDLY."</p>
      <p>"Cheer up, my lass," he said, kindly; "I too have missed the coach, and I too
      must reach Brussels to-night. I have two thousand francs in notes and gold in my
      pocketbook, which are the savings of a lifetime, and I am going to pay them into
      the bank tomorrow. Then I shall give up my trade and start a little shop."</p>
      <p>"I would not talk too much about them in the meantime, friend. In some countries
      it might be dangerous, but we are honest in Belgium."</p>
      <p>It was the other man who spoke, and his voice, though rough, was not unpleasant.
      He paid the landlord, caught up his stick, and with a curt "Good-day" passed out of
      "Les Trois Fr&egrave;res."</p>
      <p>"He, also, perhaps, is going to Brussels. He means to walk, and if he, why not
      I?" said the pedlar. He had come in cold and tired, and the landlord's good ale had
      made him slightly loquacious. "Yes, I shall try and walk. The roads are better
      walking than driving. It is not so very many miles, and most likely I shall be
      overtaken by some cart going the same way." And he rose as he spoke.</p>
      <p>Babette rose also and caught him eagerly by the hand. "I will walk with you,"
      she cried. "I am strong, well shod, and the fastest walker in our village. We can
      get to Brussels before dark, in spite of my having my boy to carry. Oh! bless you
      for thinking of it, for now I shall see Paul before the year is out."</p>
      <p>Nor would she be dissuaded. Farmer Jean came in and said something about snow.
      "The sky was darkening for it already." But Babette was firm. The landlord's buxom
      wife came forth from an inner room and offered her a lodging for the night, and
      then, when she could not persuade her, helped her to wrap the baby up afresh, and
      finally made her place in her pocket a tiny flask of brandy, "in case," she said,
      "the snow should overtake them."</p>
      <p>So they started. Babette had spoken the truth when she called herself a good
      walker. She was but twenty, and was both slight and active. The pedlar too, in
      spite of his bent form, got over the ground quickly. They had put four or five good
      miles between themselves and "Les Trois Fr&egrave;res" when the snow began to fall.
      It came down steadily in thick, heavy flakes. Babette drew her cloak yet closer
      round her boy and they plodded on, but walking became more and more difficult, and
      they grew both weary and cold. Suddenly, by the roadside, several yards ahead, they
      saw a man's figure. He was coming to meet them, and drew near rapidly, and then
      they recognised their friend in the shabby brown clothes, who had left the inn so
      shortly before them.</p>
      <p>"I saw you coming," he explained, "so came to meet you. Madame"&mdash;with a bow
      to Babette, polite for one so uncouth looking&mdash;"can go no further to-night;
      the storm will not pass off yet. I live not far from here with my mother and
      brothers, and if madame likes, we can all take shelter under my humble roof. It is
      but a poor place, but you will be welcome, and doubtless we can find two spare
      beds."</p>
      <p>They could do nothing but thank him and accept his offer. Even Babette
      acknowledged that all hope of reaching Brussels was now over. The New Year would
      have dawned before she and her husband met.</p>
      <p>The wind had risen and the snow, half turned to sleet, was now beating furiously
      into their faces. It was all they could do to keep their feet. They struggled on
      after their guide as best they could, till he turned out of the high road into a
      lane; and thankful were they when he stopped, and, pushing open a gate that creaked
      on rusty hinges, led them up a narrow, gravelled pathway to a small, bare house,
      flanked on either side by some dreary bushes of evergreens.</p>
      <p>In answer to his peremptory knock, the door was opened by a man slighter and
      shorter than himself, but sufficiently like him to be known as his brother, and the
      travellers staggered in&mdash;the door, with a heavy crash, blowing to behind
      them.</p>
      <p>Perhaps now for the first time it really struck Babette that she had been
      headstrong in persisting in her journey, and in trusting herself and child to the
      mercy of utter strangers so far from home. The same thought passed through the old
      pedlar's mind, but it was too late to retreat, so they silently followed their new
      host and his brother. They went down a passage and into a room, half kitchen, half
      parlour, snugly and even comfortably furnished.</p>
      <p class="figure"><a href="images/058-1.jpg"><img width="80%"
      src="images/058-1.jpg" alt="" /></a><br />
       "A MAN AND A WOMAN SAT OVER THE FIRE."</p>
      <p>Heavy wooden shutters dulled the noise of the boisterous gale outside. A thick
      red curtain hung over the door, and a cheery log fire burnt in the stove. A man and
      woman sat over it; the man, a tall, repulsive-looking creature, with unkempt hair
      and matted beard, his age apparently about fifty. The woman looked seventy or more.
      She too had once been tall, but now old age gave her a withered, witch-like
      appearance, in spite of her great height. She was dressed in limp, faded garments,
      with a tattered shawl crossed over her chest, and had a scared, miserable look in
      her bleared old eyes. There were a few words of explanation from the man who had
      come home, and then, in gruff but not unkindly tones, he bade Babette be seated,
      and told his mother to get some supper speedily. She spread a coarse cloth on the
      wooden table, and when all was ready, lifted a large black saucepan from the stove
      and turned out a smoking, savoury-looking stew. The youngest son produced a bottle
      containing the thin acid wine of the country, and another of spirits. As he set
      them on the table, Babette noticed that across one of his hands, which were much
      smaller and whiter than those of his brothers, there ran a dull red scar that
      looked as if he had had a bad cut there. Then they all sat down, excepting the old
      mother, who busied herself in waiting on them.</p>
      <p>"It's the last good meal you'll get for some time, I'm thinking," she croaked,
      as she watched them devouring their supper, "unless you turn to and find more work
      than you've done lately. The landlord called for his rent again to-day and swore he
      would wait no longer, but turn us out if we did not pay in three days' time."</p>
      <p>"Curse him!" muttered the man who had brought the strangers in, half under his
      breath; then aloud he added, "Shut up, good mother: remember, we have visitors; and
      one a man of property, who will hardly sympathize with our poverty."</p>
      <p>Babette looked up as he spoke, and intercepted a glance so strange and savage
      that passed between the brothers and then rested on her friend the pedlar, that
      involuntarily she shuddered and turned pale.</p>
      <p>The old man, however, did not appear to notice anything unsatisfactory in the
      appearance or manners of his hosts. He had eaten to his liking, and had allowed the
      grim-looking eldest brother to fill his glass again and again with "Genievre" till
      his face began to flush, and his eyes grew dazed and heavy. Babette felt more and
      more uneasy. Oh! to be back at "Les Trois Fr&egrave;res" again, or even out in the
      snowy road! Anything would be better than sitting in this lonely house, with those
      three forbidding faces glaring on her. She rose hastily and caught up her sleeping
      child. "I am very tired, good people," she said, timidly, "and I must start betimes
      in the morning. If I might go to bed now, I should be so thankful."</p>
      <p>In answer to her request, the old woman lighted a candle, and Babette followed
      her upstairs into a small, low chamber. There was no superfluous furniture in it,
      but the little bed looked clean and inviting, and the curtains that hung in front
      of the tiny window were made of light, fresh-looking chintz. Facing the bed was a
      door, leading apparently into another room. Babette wondered if it was the one her
      friend the pedlar was to occupy, but she was not long left in doubt. The old woman
      wished her good-night and left her, and Babette, after hushing her boy to sleep
      again, had just sunk wearily into the one chair the room boasted, when she heard a
      slow, heavy step ascending, and knew the pedlar was coming to bed. He shut the
      outer door behind him, and began arranging his pack.</p>
      <p>Babette could hear the pedlar moving backwards and forwards with uncertain,
      tired footsteps. There was no sound below, even the wind was hushed. She drew aside
      the curtains and looked out, and saw that the snow had ceased to fall, and lay
      thick and white on the ground.</p>
      <p>Then there came a sudden presentiment upon her. A sense of danger, vague and
      undefined, seemed to surround her. It was all the more terrible on account of its
      vagueness. She did not know what she feared, yet the terror of something horrible
      was strong upon her.</p>
      <p>She slipped off her boots, and stole gently up to the door that divided her room
      from the pedlar's.</p>
      <p>"Sir," she whispered, "you are very, very tired, and will sleep heavily. I am so
      anxious, I don't know why; but forgive me and do trust me. Push your pocket-book
      that contains your money under the door. See&mdash;it does not fit tight! We don't
      know who the people of the house are: they may try to rob you. I will tie it up
      inside my baby's shawls, and will give it back to you as soon as we are out of this
      place. Oh, would to God that we had never entered it! Your money will be safe with
      me, and they will never think of looking for it here. Will you give it me?"</p>
      <p>In answer to her pleadings, a shabby little leather book was pushed into her
      room. As she picked it up and proceeded to hide it securely away beneath the baby's
      many wrappings, the pedlar said, in a voice rendered hoarse and indistinct by the
      spirits he had partaken of in such unaccustomed quantities: "Here, my dear, take
      it. It will, I know, be safe with you. I feel so tired that I don't think a cannon
      would wake me to-night once I get to sleep." He groped his way to his bed, and
      flung himself down on it, dressed as he was. Soon Babette heard him snoring loudly
      and regularly, and then she took off her clothes, and rolling her cloak around her,
      lay down by the side of her child.</p>
      <p>In after years, when she looked on that awful time, she often wondered how,
      feeling as she did that she was surrounded by so many unknown perils, she had ever
      closed her eyes. Perhaps the long walk and the excitement she had undergone
      accounted for the profound sleep into which she fell almost immediately, and from
      which she was aroused in the dead of night by a noise in the next room. It was
      neither snore nor cry. It was more like a long, shuddering gurgle, and
      then&mdash;silence! Frightful, terrible silence, broken at last by the sound of
      stealthy footsteps and hushed voices. Babette sunk down on her pillow again, her
      baby clutched in her arms. A voiceless prayer went up to Heaven for the child's
      safety and her own, for already she heard them approaching her door, and made sure
      her last hour was come. Through nearly closed eyelids she watched two of the men
      enter; the one who had brought them to the house and his elder brother. They were
      muttering curses, low but deep.</p>
      <p>"To have risked so much for nothing!" whispered one. "Can she have it, or was
      the old fool jesting with us?"</p>
      <p>"It's a jest that has cost him dear," answered the other, as he watched his
      brother search the girl's clothes and then slip his murderous hands beneath her
      pillow. He withdrew them empty.</p>
      <p>"Shall we settle her?" he asked, "or let her go? Is it not best to be on the
      safe side?"</p>
      <p>But the smooth-shaven one said, decisively: "Let her alone; we have enough to
      answer for. See, she is sound asleep, and if not, it will be easy to find out
      before she reaches Brussels how much she knows. Let her be."</p>
      <p>Babette lay like a log, stirring neither hand nor foot. In that awful moment,
      when her life or death was trembling in the balance, her mother love, that divine
      instinct implanted in every woman's breast, came to her and saved her. She knew
      that if she moved her baby's life was gone&mdash;her own she hardly cared about
      just then. But those little limbs that were nestling so soft and warm against her
      own, and that little flaxen head that was cuddled against her arm, for their sake
      she was brave.</p>
      <p class="figure"><a href="images/060-1.jpg"><img width="100%%"
      src="images/060-1.jpg" alt="" /></a><br />
       "SHE LAY MOTIONLESS"</p>
      <p>So she lay motionless and listened, fearing that the men would hear even the
      quick, heavy throbs of her heart. But they did not. They searched quickly and
      systematically amongst all her clothing. They felt under her pillow again, but
      never thought of looking at the shawls of the baby who lay so peacefully by her
      side; and then at last they crept away and closed the door gently behind them.</p>
      <p>The room was in utter darkness. For ages, as it seemed, Babette lay there,
      afraid to stir, and listening vainly for some sound; then she sat up, all white and
      trembling.</p>
      <p>"My God!" she thought. "What awful thing has happened? Oh, give me strength and
      courage, for my baby's sake."</p>
      <p>As an inspiration, there came to her the thought of the little bottle that the
      good-natured landlady of "Les Trois Fr&egrave;res" had given her. She felt in the
      pocket of her dress and drew it out, taking a long, deep draught of the fiery
      spirit. She had been on the verge of fainting, though she knew it not, and the
      brandy put new life into her. She listened for a long time and then
      gently&mdash;very gently&mdash;she crept out of bed and drew aside the little
      curtain from the window.</p>
      <p>Perhaps a wild idea of escaping into the cold, dark night outside, aided by a
      sheet or blanket, flashed through her brain. If so, she soon realized that it would
      not be practicable. The window was not high, but it was small, and divided by
      thick, old-fashioned bars of iron. To get out was impossible.</p>
      <div style="float:left; width: 60%;">
        <p class="figure"><a href="images/061-1.jpg"><img width="100%"
        src="images/061-1.jpg" alt="" /></a><br />
         "SHE STOOD CONSIDERING."</p>
      </div>
      <p>As she stood considering, a thin, flickering moonbeam crept in and partially
      lighted up the room. It fell on to the door that led into the pedlar's chamber, and
      showed her something dark and slimy that was flowing slowly&mdash;slowly from under
      it into her room. She did not cry out or fall senseless. She bent down and put her
      hand into it, and saw that it was blood&mdash;her poor old friend's
      life-blood&mdash;for she knew now beyond all doubt that he had been murdered for
      the sake of his supposed wealth.</p>
      <p>She knew she was helpless till morning. To get out of the house was impossible,
      for to do so she must pass down the stairs and through the room below, where
      probably they were either sleeping or watching. If she had courage and could only
      let them think she knew and suspected nothing, she might still escape. Surely they
      would not dare to murder her also, for they knew her husband would be expecting her
      next day, and would be looking for her if she did not come.</p>
      <p>With another prayer, this time uttered shiveringly, for the soul of the pedlar,
      she nerved herself to get into bed again, and lay there till morning with her child
      against her heart; gazing with staring, sleepless eyes at the door which divided
      her from that awful room; keeping surely the most terrible vigil that ever woman
      kept.</p>
      <p>At last the morning dawned, clear and bright. A frost had set in, and the roads
      were clean and hard, the sky was blue. If it had not been for that ghastly stain
      that had crept across the far end of her room, she might almost have thought that
      the events of the night had been but a fearful dream.</p>
      <p>Her child awoke, fresh and smiling, and she could hear them stirring in the
      living room below. She felt that now, indeed, the hardest part of her task was
      still before her. On a little table by the side of her bed there was a small,
      cracked looking-glass. When she was dressed she looked into it and saw that it
      reflected a face death-like in its pallor, with burning lips and feverish eyes. She
      took the bottle from her pocket again and gulped down the rest of its contents. It
      sent a flush into her cheeks and steadied the sick trembling that was shaking her
      through and through.</p>
      <p>Without stopping to think or look round again, she took up her boy and descended
      the stairs, and entered the room where they had supped on the previous night.</p>
      <p>The old woman was its sole occupant now. She was bending over the fire frying
      something for breakfast, and the table in the centre of the room was prepared for
      the meal. She looked if possible more untidy and slovenly than when Babette had
      last seen her, and greeted the girl with a feeble smile.</p>
      <p>Then she poured her out a cup of coffee, and Babette had sat down and begun to
      sip it (for she knew she must make a pretence of breakfasting) when the eldest son
      came in. There was a very uneasy look upon his evil-looking face.</p>
      <p>"How are you?" he asked, sullenly, as he sat down opposite her. "I hope, rested.
      Did you sleep well?"</p>
      <p>Never afterwards did she know how she found courage to answer him as she did,
      quietly and firmly:&mdash;</p>
      <p>"Yes, very well, thank you. But my friend&mdash;he must have over-slept
      himself&mdash;why is he not down?"</p>
      <p>The old woman dropped a plate with a clatter and turned round. The man looked
      Babette straight in the face as he replied, and she met his glance with one just as
      steady.</p>
      <p>"The pedlar is gone," he said, as he sugared his coffee carefully. "He paid his
      bill and was off before seven. You will probably see him in Brussels, for he was
      going there."</p>
      <p>"Yes," repeated Babette, "I shall very likely meet him in Brussels, but I don't
      even know his name. And I, too, good people, ought to be starting. The morning is
      fine, and walking will be easy." She drank down her coffee as she spoke and rose.
      "I cannot eat," she exclaimed, seeing that they both looked suspiciously at the
      thick slice of currant-bread, that lay untouched on her plate. "I think I am
      excited at the thought of seeing my husband again. It seems so long since we
      parted, and now we shall meet so soon."</p>
      <p>In her own ears her voice sounded far away and unnatural, but they did not seem
      to notice anything strange in her. The old woman, with a meek "Thank you," took the
      humble payment she tendered, and they let her go; only the big, burly eldest son
      stood at the door and watched her as she went slowly down the little pathway and
      out through the creaking gate into the snowy road. She only looked back once, and
      then she saw that a dingy signboard hung in front of the house. The picture of what
      was meant for a cow, and had once been white, was depicted on it, and the words "A
      la Vache Blanche" were clumsily painted underneath. So the house was an inn,
      evidently, and as Babette read the words she dimly remembered having heard, long
      ago, that there was an inn of that name not far from Brussels. It was kept by some
      people named Marac, whose characters were anything but good, and who had been
      implicated in several robberies that had taken place some years before, although
      the utmost efforts of the police had failed to trace any crime directly home to
      them.</p>
      <p>"Oh, heavens! Why did I not see that sign last night?" the girl thought,
      despairingly, as she trudged along the hard, frosty road. "It would have saved his
      life and perhaps my reason."</p>
      <p>She sped along faster and faster, for the house was now quite out of sight. In
      the distance the way began to wind up-hill, and a stunted, leafless wood straggled
      along one side of the highway. Babette was just considering whether going through
      it would shorten her journey, when a woman, dressed in the ordinary peasant costume
      of the country, emerged from it and came towards her with quick, firm steps. She
      was tall and rather masculine looking. The black Flemish cloak she wore hung round
      her in straight, thick folds. She carried a market basket on one arm; a neat white
      cloth concealing the eggs and butter that probably lay underneath.</p>
      <p>"Good-day," she said, in thick, guttural tones, as she reached Babette. "Are you
      on the way to Brussels?"</p>
      <p>Babette made way for her to pass, somewhat shyly.</p>
      <p>"Yes," she said, "and I am in haste; but the roads are heavy and I have my baby
      to carry."</p>
      <p>As she answered, her eyes happened to fall on the stranger's right hand, which
      was ungloved and clasping the basket. And as she looked her heart seemed suddenly
      to quiver and stand still, for across that strong right hand there ran a deep red
      scar, precisely similar to the one she had noticed on the previous night on the
      hand of the youngest brother at the "Vache Blanche."</p>
      <p>It did not take long for the whole horrible truth to flash across her. Doubtless
      they had felt insecure after their terrible deed, and the youngest Marac had been
      dispatched after her, disguised as a woman, with instructions to way-lay her by
      some shorter cut, in order to find out if she was really ignorant of the frightful
      way in which the pedlar had met his untimely end.</p>
      <p>As these thoughts chased each other through her mind, she felt as if her great
      terror was slowly blanching her face, and her limbs began to tremble till she could
      hardly drag herself over the ground. But her baby's warm little heart, beating so
      closely against her own, once more gave her strength. She dropped her eyes so that
      she might no longer see that awful hand, and tottered on by the new-comer's side,
      striving to imagine that it was indeed only a harmless peasant woman who was
      walking by her and trying to remember that every step was bringing her nearer to
      Brussels and protection. Her companion glanced at her curiously, and Babette
      shivered, for she fancied she saw suspicion in the look.</p>
      <p>"You seem tired." she, or rather he, said, always speaking in the same low,
      thick tones. "Brussels is barely two miles off, and it is yet early, but perhaps
      you have not rested well. Where did you sleep?"</p>
      <p>Too well did the girl know why that question was asked her, and now that her
      first sickening horror was over, her brave spirit nerved itself once more.</p>
      <p>"I was journeying with a friend yesterday," she replied, "when the snow-storm
      overtook us. Luckily we met a man whose home lay in our road. He was very good, and
      took us there and gave us supper and beds."</p>
      <p>The stranger laughed.</p>
      <p>"A good Samaritan, indeed! And your friend? Where is he now? Did he find his
      hosts so hospitable that he was unable to tear himself away?"</p>
      <p>"No," said Babette, gently, "he started early; before I came down he was far on
      his road. They were very good to me, and gave me coffee before I left. I am a poor
      woman, and could do but little to repay them. The two francs I gave them were
      almost my last."</p>
      <p>This speech, uttered in such a soft, even voice&mdash;for Babette had schooled
      herself well by now&mdash;seemed to satisfy her companion, and they walked on side
      by side in silence for what seemed to the poor girl the longest hour she had ever
      passed.</p>
      <p>At last, in the far distance there rose the spires and roofs of Brussels. The
      chiming of church bells came gaily towards them through the frosty air, and Babette
      knew that her terrible journey was well-nigh ended. At the entrance of the town the
      stranger stopped.</p>
      <p class="figure"><a href="images/063-1.jpg"><img width="90%"
      src="images/063-1.jpg" alt="" /></a><br />
       "GOOD-BYE."</p>
      <p>"Good-bye," she said, curtly; "I am late for the market, and must sell my eggs
      quickly or shall not get my price."</p>
      <div style="float:right; width:60%;">
        <p class="figure"><a href="images/064-1.jpg"><img width="100%"
        src="images/064-1.jpg" alt="" /></a><br />
         "SHE SANK DOWN IN A HEAVY, DEATH-LIKE SWOON."</p>
      </div>
      <p>She turned down a side street and disappeared, and Babette felt her strength and
      mind both failing her now that she was out of danger. She staggered weakly into a
      big, dim church, by the door of which the parting happened to have taken place.
      Here she sank down in a heavy, death-like swoon in front of one of the side altars,
      with her baby wailing fretfully at her breast. When she came to herself again she
      was seated in the sacristy, and her hair and face were wet with the water they had
      flung over her. By her side stood a black-robed, kindly-faced cur&eacute; and two
      or three women, who were trying to force some wine down her throat. By degrees her
      strength came back, and she raised herself and asked piteously for her child. Then,
      when he was in her arms, she told her story.</p>
      <p>Wonder, horror, and bewilderment all dawned in turns on her hearers'
      countenances, and it was not until she unpinned her baby's shawls and handed the
      shabby pocket-book to the priest that they were quite certain they had not to deal
      with some poor, wandering lunatic. But when the money had been looked at and
      replaced, then, indeed, they saw the necessity for prompt action. The cur&eacute;
      caught up his hat, and, after whispering a few words to the women, hurried out of
      the sacristy.</p>
      <p>"He is gone to the police," said one. "Poor child"&mdash;laying her hand
      caressingly on the girl's damp hair&mdash;"what hast thou not passed through!
      Mercifully the mass was not over, so we found thee at once. Lie still and rest.
      Give me but thy husband's name and address, and in one little half-hour he shall be
      by thy side."</p>
      <p>And so he was, and then, when she had been examined by the chief of the police
      and sobbed out her story all over again, from the shelter of Paul's broad arms, she
      felt safe at last. She went peacefully home with her husband, and after a good
      night's rest in the little rooms he had taken for her, she was able to listen
      calmly when told next day of the capture of the whole Marac family. They had been
      taken red-handed in their guilt, for had not the pedlar's body been found in a
      disused cellar under their house?</p>
      <p>He was brought to Brussels to be buried, but his name was never known, and his
      money was never claimed. Probably, as he had told Babette, he had been a friendless
      old man, wandering alone from place to place.</p>
      <p>The police were generous. Half his money was given to the poor and the rest was
      handed to Babette, and helped to furnish her new home. A simple stone cross now
      marks the unknown pedlar's grave: but flowers bloom there abundantly, and though
      nameless, he is not forgotten. Many a prayer is uttered for him both by Babette and
      her children, for the memory of that terrible New Year's Eve will never fade from
      her mind.</p>

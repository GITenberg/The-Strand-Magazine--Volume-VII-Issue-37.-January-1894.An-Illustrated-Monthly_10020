       "THE HORROR OF STUDLEY GRANGE."</p>
      <p>I was in my consulting-room one morning, and had just said good-bye to the last
      of my patients, when my servant came in and told me that a lady had called who
      pressed very earnestly for an interview with me.</p>
      <p>"I told her that you were just going out, sir," said the man, "and she saw the
      carriage at the door; but she begged to see you, if only for two minutes. This is
      her card."</p>
      <p>I read the words, "Lady Studley."</p>
      <p>"Show her in," I said, hastily, and the next moment a tall, slightly-made,
      fair-haired girl entered the room.</p>
      <p>She looked very young, scarcely more than twenty, and I could hardly believe
      that she was, what her card indicated, a married woman.</p>
      <p>The colour rushed into her cheeks as she held out her hand to me. I motioned her
      to a chair, and then asked her what I could do for her.</p>
      <p>"Oh, you can help me," she said, clasping her hands and speaking in a slightly
      theatrical manner. "My husband, Sir Henry Studley, is very unwell, and I want you
      to come to see him&mdash;can you?&mdash;will you?"</p>
      <p>"With pleasure," I replied. "Where do you live?"</p>
      <p>"At Studley Grange, in Wiltshire. Don't you know our place?"</p>
      <p>"I daresay I ought to know it," I replied, "although at the present moment I
      can't recall the name. You want me to come to see your husband. I presume you wish
      me to have a consultation with his medical attendant?"</p>
      <p>"No, no, not at all. The fact is, Sir Henry has not got a medical attendant. He
      dislikes doctors, and won't see one. I want you to come and stay with us for a week
      or so. I have heard of you through mutual friends&mdash;the Onslows. I know you can
      effect remarkable cures, and you have a great deal of tact. But you can't possibly
      do anything for my husband unless you are willing to stay in the house and to
      notice his symptoms."</p>

         "LADY STUDLEY SPOKE WITH GREAT EMPHASIS."<br />
        </p>
      </div>
      <p>Lady Studley spoke with great emphasis and earnestness. Her long, slender hands
      were clasped tightly together. She had drawn off her gloves and was bending forward
      in her chair. Her big, childish, and somewhat restless blue eyes were fixed
      imploringly on my face.</p>
      <p>"I love my husband," she said, tears suddenly filling them&mdash;"and it is
      dreadful, dreadful, to see him suffer as he does. He will die unless someone comes
      to his aid. Oh, I know I am asking an immense thing, when I beg of you to leave all
      your patients and come to the country. But we can pay. Money is no object whatever
      to us. We can, we will, gladly pay you for your services."</p>
      <p>"I must think the matter over," I said. "You flatter me by wishing for me, and
      by believing that I can render you assistance, but I cannot take a step of this
      kind in a hurry. I will write to you by to-night's post if you will give me your
      address. In the meantime, kindly tell me some of the symptoms of Sir Henry's
      malady."</p>
      <p>"I fear it is a malady of the mind," she answered immediately, "but it is of so
      vivid and so startling a character, that unless relief is soon obtained, the body
      must give way under the strain. You see that I am very young, Dr. Halifax. Perhaps
      I look younger than I am&mdash;my age is twenty-two. My husband is twenty years my
      senior. He would, however, be considered by most people still a young man. He is a
      great scholar, and has always had more or less the habits of a recluse. He is fond
      of living in his library, and likes nothing better than to be surrounded by books
      of all sorts. Every modern book worth reading is forwarded to him by its publisher.
      He is a very interesting man and a brilliant conversationalist. Perhaps I ought to
      put all this in the past tense, for now he scarcely ever speaks&mdash;he reads next
      to nothing&mdash;it is difficult to persuade him to eat&mdash;he will not leave the
      house&mdash;he used to have a rather ruddy complexion&mdash;he is now deadly pale
      and terribly emaciated. He sighs in the most heartrending manner, and seems to be
      in a state of extreme nervous tension. In short, he is very ill, and yet he seems
      to have no bodily disease. His eyes have a terribly startled expression in
      them&mdash;his hand trembles so that he can scarcely raise a cup of tea to his
      lips. In short, he looks like a man who has seen a ghost."</p>
      <p>"When did these symptoms begin to appear?" I asked.</p>
      <p>"It is mid-winter now," said Lady Studley. "The queer symptoms began to show
      themselves in my husband in October. They have been growing worse and worse. In
      short, I can stand them no longer," she continued, giving way to a short,
      hysterical sob. "I felt I must come to someone&mdash;I have heard of you. Do, do
      come and save us. Do come and find out what is the matter with my wretched
      husband."</p>
      <p>"I will write to you to-night," I said, in as kind a voice as I could muster,
      for the pretty, anxious wife interested me already. "It may not be possible for me
      to stay at Studley Grange for a week, but in any case I can promise to come and see
      the patient. One visit will probably be sufficient&mdash;what your husband wants
      is, no doubt, complete change."</p>
      <p>"Oh, yes, yes," she replied, standing up now. "I have said so scores of times,
      but Sir Henry won't stir from Studley&mdash;nothing will induce him to go away. He
      won't even leave his own special bedroom, although I expect he has dreadful
      nights." Two hectic spots burnt in her cheeks as she spoke. I looked at her
      attentively.</p>
      <p>"You will forgive me for speaking," I said, "but you do not look at all well
      yourself. I should like to prescribe for you as well as your husband."</p>
      <p>"Thank you," she answered, "I am not very strong. I never have been, but that is
      nothing&mdash;I mean that my health is not a thing of consequence at present. Well,
      I must not take up any more of your time. I shall expect to get a letter from you
      to-morrow morning. Please address it to Lady Studley, Grosvenor Hotel,
      Victoria."</p>
      <p>She touched my hand with fingers that burnt like a living coal and left the
      room.</p>
      <p>I thought her very ill, and was sure that if I could see my way to spending a
      week at Studley Grange, I should have two patients instead of one. It is always
      difficult for a busy doctor to leave home, but after carefully thinking matters
      over, I resolved to comply with Lady Studley's request.</p>
      <div style="float:left; width: 50%;">

         "LADY STUDLEY HAD COME HERSELF TO FETCH ME."</p>
      </div>
      <p>Accordingly, two days later saw me on my way to Wiltshire, and to Studley
      Grange. A brougham with two smart horses was waiting at the station. To my surprise
      I saw that Lady Studley had come herself to fetch me.</p>
      <p>"I don't know how to thank you," she said, giving me a feverish clasp of her
      hand. "Your visit fills me with hope&mdash;I believe that you will discover what is
      really wrong. Home!" she said, giving a quick, imperious direction to the footman
      who appeared at the window of the carriage.</p>
      <p>We bowled forward at a rapid pace, and she continued:&mdash;</p>
      <p>"I came to meet you to-day to tell you that I have used a little guile with
      regard to your visit. I have not told Sir Henry that you are coming here in the
      capacity of a doctor."</p>
      <p>Here she paused and gave me one of her restless glances.</p>
      <p>"Do you mind?" she asked.</p>
      <p>"What have you said about me to Sir Henry?" I inquired.</p>
      <p>"That you are a great friend of the Onslows, and that I have asked you here for
      a week's change," she answered immediately.</p>
      <p>"As a guest, my husband will be polite and delightful to you&mdash;as a doctor,
      he would treat you with scant civility, and would probably give you little or none
      of his confidence."</p>
      <p>I was quite silent for a moment after Lady Studley had told me this. Then I
      said:&mdash;</p>
      <p>"Had I known that I was not to come to your house in the capacity of a medical
      man, I might have re-considered my earnest desire to help you."</p>
      <p>She turned very pale when I said this, and tears filled her eyes.</p>
      <p>"Never mind," I said now, for I could not but be touched by her extremely
      pathetic and suffering face, by the look of great illness which was manifested in
      every glance. "Never mind now; I am glad you have told me exactly the terms on
      which you wish me to approach your husband; but I think that I can so put matters
      to Sir Henry that he will be glad to consult me in my medical capacity."</p>
      <p>"Oh, but he does not even know that I suspect his illness. It would never do for
      him to know. I suspect! I see! I fear! but I say nothing. Sir Henry would be much
      more miserable than he is now, if he thought that I guessed that there is anything
      wrong with him."</p>
      <p>"It is impossible for me to come to the Grange except as a medical man," I
      answered, firmly. "I will tell Sir Henry that you have seen some changes in him,
      and have asked me to visit him as a doctor. Please trust me. Nothing will be said
      to your husband that can make matters at all uncomfortable for you."</p>
      <p>Lady Studley did not venture any further remonstrance, and we now approached the
      old Grange. It was an irregular pile, built evidently according to the wants of the
      different families who had lived in it. The building was long and rambling, with
      rows of windows filled up with panes of latticed glass. In front of the house was a
      sweeping lawn, which, even at this time of the year, presented a velvety and
      well-kept appearance. We drove rapidly round to the entrance door, and a moment
      later I found myself in the presence of my host and patient. Sir Henry Studley was
      a tall man with a very slight stoop, and an aquiline and rather noble face. His
      eyes were dark, and his forehead inclined to be bald. There was a courtly,
      old-world sort of look about him. He greeted me with extreme friendliness, and we
      went into the hall, a very large and lofty apartment, to tea.</p>
      <p>Lady Studley was vivacious and lively in the extreme. While she talked, the
      hectic spots came out again on her cheeks. My uneasiness about her increased as I
      noticed these symptoms. I felt certain that she was not only consumptive, but in
      all probability she was even now the victim of an advanced stage of phthisis. I
      felt far more anxious about her than about her husband, who appeared to me at that
      moment to be nothing more than a somewhat nervous and hypochondriacal person. This
      state of things seemed easy to account for in a scholar and a man of sedentary
      habits.</p>
      <p>I remarked about the age of the house, and my host became interested, and told
      me one or two stories of the old inhabitants of the Grange. He said that to-morrow
      he would have much pleasure in taking me over the building.</p>

         "'HAVE YOU A GHOST HERE?' I ASKED, WITH A LAUGH."</p>
      </div>
      <p>"Have you a ghost here?" I asked, with a laugh.</p>
      <p>I don't know what prompted me to ask the question. The moment I did so, Sir
      Henry turned white to his lips, and Lady Studley held up a warning finger to me to
      intimate that I was on dangerous ground. I felt that I was, and hastened to divert
      the conversation into safer channels. Inadvertently I had touched on a sore spot. I
      scarcely regretted having done so, as the flash in the baronet's troubled eyes, and
      the extreme agitation of his face, showed me plainly that Lady Studley was right
      when she spoke of his nerves being in a very irritable condition. Of course, I did
      not believe in ghosts, and wondered that a man of Sir Henry's calibre could be at
      all under the influence of this old-world fear.</p>
      <p>"I am sorry that we have no one to meet you," he said, after a few remarks of a
      commonplace character had divided us from the ghost question. "But to-morrow
      several friends are coming, and we hope you will have a pleasant time. Are you fond
      of hunting?"</p>
      <p>I answered that I used to be in the old days, before medicine and patients
      occupied all my thoughts.</p>
      <p>"If this open weather continues, I can probably give you some of your favourite
      pastime," rejoined Sir Henry; "and now perhaps you would like to be shown to your
      room."</p>
      <p>My bedroom was in a modern wing of the house, and looked as cheerful and as
      unghostlike as it was possible for a room to be. I did not rejoin my host and
      hostess until dinner-time. We had a sociable little meal, at which nothing of any
      importance occurred, and shortly after the servants withdrew, Lady Studley left Sir
      Henry and me to ourselves. She gave me another warning glance as she left the room.
      I had already quite made up my mind, however, to tell Sir Henry the motive of my
      visit.</p>
      <p>The moment the door closed behind his wife, he started up and asked me if I
      would mind coming with him into his library.</p>
      <p>"The fact is." he said, "I am particularly glad you have come down. I want to
      have a talk with you about my wife. She is extremely unwell."</p>
      <p>I signified my willingness to listen to anything Sir Henry might say, and in a
      few minutes we found ourselves comfortably established in a splendid old room,
      completely clothed with books from ceiling to floor.</p>
      <p>"These are my treasures," said the baronet, waving his hand in the direction of
      an old bookcase, which contained, I saw at a glance, some very rare and precious
      first editions.</p>
      <p>"These are my friends, the companions of my hours of solitude. Now sit down, Dr.
      Halifax; make yourself at home. You have come here as a guest, but I have heard of
      you before, and am inclined to confide in you. I must frankly say that I hate your
      profession as a rule. I don't believe in the omniscience of medical men, but
      moments come in the lives of all men when it is necessary to unburden the mind to
      another. May I give you my confidence?"</p>
      <p>"One moment first," I said. "I can't deceive you, Sir Henry. I have come here,
      not in the capacity of a guest, but as your wife's medical man. She has been
      anxious about you, and she begged of me to come and stay here for a few days in
      order to render you any medical assistance within my power. I only knew, on my way
      here to-day, that she had not acquainted you with the nature of my visit."</p>
      <p>While I was speaking, Sir Henry's face became extremely watchful, eager, and
      tense.</p>
      <p>"This is remarkable," he said. "So Lucilla is anxious about me? I was not aware
      that I ever gave her the least clue to the fact that I am not&mdash;in perfect
      health. This is very strange&mdash;it troubles me."</p>
      <p>He looked agitated. He placed one long, thin hand on the little table which
      stood near, and pouring out a glass of wine, drank it off. I noticed as he did so
      the nervous trembling of his hand. I glanced at his face, and saw that it was thin
      to emaciation.</p>
      <p>"Well," he said, "I am obliged to you for being perfectly frank with me. My wife
      scarcely did well to conceal the object of your visit. But now that you have come,
      I shall make use of you both for myself and for her."</p>
      <p>"Then you are not well?" I asked.</p>
      <p>"Well!" he answered, with almost a shout. "Good God, no! I think that I am going
      mad. I know&mdash;I know that unless relief soon comes I shall die or become a
      raving maniac."</p>
      <p>"No, nothing of the kind," I answered, soothingly; "you probably want change.
      This is a fine old house, but dull, no doubt, in winter. Why don't you go
      away?&mdash;to the Riviera, or some other place where there is plenty of sunshine?
      Why do you stay here? The air of this place is too damp to be good for either you
      or your wife."</p>
      <p>Sir Henry sat silent for a moment, then he said, in a terse voice:&mdash;</p>
      <p>"Perhaps you will advise me what to do after you know the nature of the malady
      which afflicts me. First of all, however, I wish to speak of my wife."</p>
      <p>"I am ready to listen," I replied.</p>
      <p>"You see," he continued, "that she is very delicate?"</p>
      <p>"Yes," I replied; "to be frank with you, I should say that Lady Studley was
      consumptive."</p>
      <p>He started when I said this, and pressed his lips firmly together. After a
      moment he spoke.</p>
      <p>"You are right," he replied. "I had her examined by a medical man&mdash;Sir
      Joseph Dunbar&mdash;when I was last in London; he said her lungs were considerably
      affected, and that, in short, she was far from well."</p>
      <p>"Did he not order you to winter abroad?"</p>
      <p>"He did, but Lady Studley opposed the idea so strenuously that I was obliged to
      yield to her entreaties. Consumption does not seem to take quite the ordinary form
      with her. She is restless, she longs for cool air, she goes out on quite cold days,
      in a closed carriage, it is true. Still, except at night, she does not regard
      herself in any sense as an invalid. She has immense spirit&mdash;I think she will
      keep up until she dies."</p>
      <p>"You speak of her being an invalid at night," I replied. "What are her
      symptoms?"</p>
      <p>Sir Henry shuddered quite visibly.</p>
      <p>"Oh, those awful nights!" he answered. "How happy would many poor mortals be,
      but for the terrible time of darkness. Lady Studley has had dreadful nights for
      some time: perspirations, cough, restlessness, bad dreams, and all the rest of it.
      But I must hasten to tell you my story quite briefly. In the beginning of October
      we saw Sir Joseph Dunbar. I should then, by his advice, have taken Lady Studley to
      the Riviera, but she opposed the idea with such passion and distress, that I
      abandoned it."</p>
      <p>Sir Henry paused here, and I looked at him attentively. I remembered at that
      moment what Lady Studley had said about her husband refusing to leave the Grange
      under any circumstances. What a strange game of cross-purposes these two were
      playing. How was it possible for me to get at the truth?</p>
      <p>"At my wife's earnest request," continued Sir Henry, "we returned to the Grange.
      She declared her firm intention of remaining here until she died.</p>
      <p>"Soon after our return she suggested that we should occupy separate rooms at
      night, reminding me, when she made the request, of the infectious nature of
      consumption. I complied with her wish on condition that I slept in the room next
      hers, and that on the smallest emergency I should be summoned to her aid. This
      arrangement was made, and her room opens into mine. I have sometimes heard her
      moving about at night&mdash;I have often heard her cough, and I have often heard
      her sigh. But she has never once sent for me, or given me to understand that she
      required my aid. She does not think herself very ill, and nothing worries her more
      than to have her malady spoken about. That is the part of the story which relates
      to my wife."</p>
      <p>"She is very ill," I said. "But I will speak of that presently. Now will you
      favour me with an account of your own symptoms, Sir Henry?"</p>
      <div style="float:left; width: 70%;">
        <p class="figure"><a href="images/008-1.jpg"><img width="100%"
        src="images/008-1.jpg" alt="" /></a><br />
         "HE LOCKED THE DOOR AND PUT THE KEY IN HIS POCKET."</p>
      </div>
      <p>He started again when I said this, and going across the room, locked the door
      and put the key in his pocket.</p>
      <p>"Perhaps you will laugh at me," he said, "but it is no laughing matter, I assure
      you. The most terrible, the most awful affliction has come to me. In short, I am
      visited nightly by an appalling apparition. You don't believe in ghosts, I judge
      that by your face. Few scientific men do."</p>
      <p>"Frankly, I do not," I replied. "So-called ghosts can generally be accounted
      for. At the most they are only the figments of an over-excited or diseased
      brain."</p>
      <p>"Be that as it may," said Sir Henry, "the diseased brain can give such torture
      to its victim that death is preferable. All my life I have been what I consider a
      healthy minded man. I have plenty of money, and have never been troubled with the
      cares which torture men of commerce, or of small means. When I married, three years
      ago, I considered myself the most lucky and the happiest of mortals."</p>
      <p>"Forgive a personal question," I interrupted. "Has your marriage disappointed
      you?"</p>
      <p>"No, no; far from it," he replied with fervour. "I love my dear wife better and
      more deeply even than the day when I took her as a bride to my arms. It is true
      that I am weighed down with sorrow about her, but that is entirely owing to the
      state of her health."</p>
      <p>"It is strange," I said, "that she should be weighed down with sorrow about you
      for the same cause. Have you told her of the thing which terrifies you?"</p>
      <p>"Never, never. I have never spoken of it to mortal. It is remarkable that my
      wife should have told you that I looked like a man who has seen a ghost. Alas!
      alas! But let me tell you the cause of my shattered nerves, my agony, and failing
      health."</p>
      <p>"Pray do, I shall listen attentively," I replied.</p>
      <p>"Oh, doctor, that I could make you feel the horror of it!" said Sir Henry,
      bending forward and looking into my eyes. "Three months ago I no more believed in
      visitations, in apparitions, in so-called ghosts, than you do. Were you tried as I
      am, your scepticism would receive a severe shock. Now let me tell you what occurs.
      Night after night Lady Studley and I retire to rest at the same hour. We say
      good-night, and lay our heads on our separate pillows. The door of communication
      between us is shut. She has a night-light in her room&mdash;I prefer darkness. I
      close my eyes and prepare for slumber. As a rule I fall asleep. My sleep is of
      short duration. I awake with beads of perspiration standing on my forehead, with my
      heart thumping heavily and with every nerve wide awake, and waiting for the horror
      which will come. Sometimes I wait half an hour&mdash;sometimes longer. Then I know
      by a faint, ticking sound in the darkness that the Thing, for I can clothe it with
      no name, is about to visit me. In a certain spot of the room, always in the same
      spot, a bright light suddenly flashes; out of its midst there gleams a
      preternaturally large eye, which looks fixedly at me with a diabolical expression.
      As time goes, it does not remain long; but as agony counts, it seems to take years
      of my life away with it. It fades as suddenly into grey mist and nothingness as it
      comes, and, wet with perspiration, and struggling to keep back screams of mad
      terror, I bury my head in the bed-clothes."</p>
      <p>"But have you never tried to investigate this thing?" I said.</p>
      <p>"I did at first. The first night I saw it, I rushed out of bed and made for the
      spot. It disappeared at once. I struck a light&mdash;there was nothing whatever in
      the room."</p>
      <p>"Why do you sleep in that room?"</p>
      <p>"I must not go away from Lady Studley. My terror is that she should know
      anything of this&mdash;my greater terror is that the apparition, failing me, may
      visit her. I daresay you think I'm a fool, Halifax; but the fact is, this thing is
      killing me, brave man as I consider myself."</p>
      <p>"Do you see it every night?" I asked.</p>
      <div style="float:right; width: 60%;">

         "IT IS THE MOST GHASTLY, THE MOST HORRIBLE FORM OF TORTURE.</p>
      </div>
      <p>"Not quite every night, but sometimes on the same night it comes twice.
      Sometimes it will not come at all for two nights, or even three. It is the most
      ghastly, the most horrible form of torture that could hurry a sane man into his
      grave or into a madhouse."</p>
      <p>"I have not the least shadow of doubt," I said, after a pause, "that the thing
      can be accounted for."</p>
      <p>Sir Henry shook his head. "No, no," he replied, "it is either as you suggest, a
      figment of my own diseased brain, and therefore just as horrible as a real
      apparition; or it is a supernatural visitation. Whether it exists or not, it is
      reality to me and in no way a dream. The full horror of it is present with me in my
      waking moments."</p>
      <p>"Do you think anyone is playing an awful practical joke?" I suggested.</p>
      <p>"Certainly not. What object can anyone have in scaring me to death? Besides,
      there is no one in the room, that I can swear. My outer door is locked, Lady
      Studley's outer door is locked. It is impossible that there can be any trickery in
      the matter."</p>
      <p>I said nothing for a moment. I no more believed in ghosts than I ever did, but I
      felt certain that there was grave mischief at work. Sir Henry must be the victim of
      a hallucination. This might only be caused by functional disturbance of the brain,
      but it was quite serious enough to call for immediate attention. The first thing to
      do was to find out whether the apparition could be accounted for in any material
      way, or if it were due to the state of Sir Henry's nerves. I began to ask him
      certain questions, going fully into the case in all its bearings. I then examined
      his eyes with the ophthalmoscope. The result of all this was to assure me beyond
      doubt that Sir Henry Studley was in a highly nervous condition, although I could
      detect no trace of brain disease.</p>
      <p>"Do you mind taking me to your room?" I said.</p>
      <p>"Not to-night," he answered. "It is late, and Lady Studley might express
      surprise. The object of my life is to conceal this horror from her. When she is out
      to-morrow you shall come to the room and judge for yourself."</p>
      <p>"Well," I said, "I shall have an interview with your wife to-morrow, and urge
      her most strongly to consent to leave the Grange and go away with you."</p>
      <p>Shortly afterwards we retired to rest, or what went by the name of rest in that
      sad house, with its troubled inmates. I must confess that, comfortable as my room
      was, I slept very little. Sir Henry's story stayed with me all through the hours of
      darkness. I am neither nervous nor imaginative, but I could not help seeing that
      terrible eye, even in my dreams.</p>
      <p>I met my host and hostess at an early breakfast. Sir Henry proposed that as the
      day was warm and fine, I should ride to a neighbouring meet. I was not in the
      humour for this, however, and said frankly that I should prefer remaining at the
      Grange. One glance into the faces of my host and hostess told me only too plainly
      that I had two very serious patients on my hands. Lady Studley looked terribly weak
      and excited&mdash;the hectic spots on her cheeks, the gleaming glitter of her eyes,
      the parched lips, the long, white, emaciated hands, all showed only too plainly the
      strides the malady under which she was suffering was making.</p>
      <p>"After all, I cannot urge that poor girl to go abroad," I said to myself. "She
      is hastening rapidly to her grave, and no power on earth can save her. She looks as
      if there were extensive disease of the lungs. How restless her eyes are, too! I
      would much rather testify to Sir Henry's sanity than to hers."</p>
      <p>Sir Henry Studley also bore traces of a sleepless night&mdash;his face was
      bloodless; he averted his eyes from mine; he ate next to nothing.</p>
      <p>Immediately after breakfast, I followed Lady Studley into her morning-room. I
      had already made up my mind how to act. Her husband should have my full
      confidence&mdash;she only my partial view of the situation.</p>
      <p>"Well," I said, "I have seen your husband and talked to him. I hope he will soon
      be better. I don't think you need be seriously alarmed about him. Now for yourself,
      Lady Studley. I am anxious to examine your lungs. Will you allow me to do so?"</p>
      <p>"I suppose Henry has told you I am consumptive?"</p>
      <p>"He says you are not well," I answered. "I don't need his word to assure me of
      that fact&mdash;I can see it with my own eyes. Please let me examine your chest
      with my stethoscope."</p>
      <p>She hesitated for a moment, looking something like a wild creature brought to
      bay. Then she sank into a chair, and with trembling fingers unfastened her dress.
      Poor soul, she was almost a walking skeleton&mdash;her beautiful face was all that
      was beautiful about her. A brief examination told me that she was in the last stage
      of phthisis&mdash;in short, that her days were numbered.</p>
      <p>"What do you think of me?" she asked, when the brief examination was over.</p>
      <p>"You are ill," I replied.</p>
      <p>"How soon shall I die?"</p>
      <p>"God only knows that, my dear lady," I answered.</p>
      <p>"Oh, you needn't hide your thoughts," she said. "I know that my days are very
      few. Oh, if only, if only my husband could come with me! I am so afraid to go
      alone, and I am fond of him, very fond of him."</p>
      <p>I soothed her as well as I could.</p>
      <p>"You ought to have someone to sleep in your room at night," I said. "You ought
      not to be left by yourself."</p>
      <p>"Henry is near me&mdash;in the next room," she replied. "I would not have a
      nurse for the world&mdash;I hate and detest nurses."</p>
      <p>Soon afterwards she left me. She was very erratic, and before she left the room
      she had quite got over her depression. The sun shone out, and with the gleam of
      brightness her volatile spirits rose.</p>
      <p>"I am going for a drive," she said. "Will you come with me?"</p>
      <p>"Not this morning," I replied. "If you ask me to-morrow, I shall be pleased to
      accompany you."</p>
      <p>"Well, go to Henry," she answered. "Talk to him&mdash;find out what ails him,
      order tonics for him. Cheer him in every way in your power. You say he is not
      ill&mdash;not seriously ill&mdash;I know better. My impression is that if my days
      are numbered, so are his."</p>
      <p>She went away, and I sought her husband. As soon as the wheels of her brougham
      were heard bowling away over the gravel sweep, we went up together to his room.</p>
      <p>"That eye came twice last night," he said in an awestruck whisper to me. "I am a
      doomed man&mdash;a doomed man. I cannot bear this any longer."</p>
      <p>We were standing in the room as he said the words. Even in broad daylight, I
      could see that he glanced round him with apprehension. He was shaking quite
      visibly. The room was decidedly old-fashioned, but the greater part of the
      furniture was modern. The bed was an Albert one with a spring mattress, and light,
      cheerful dimity hangings. The windows were French&mdash;they were wide open, and
      let in the soft, pleasant air, for the day was truly a spring one in winter. The
      paper on the walls was light.</p>
      <p>"This is a quaint old wardrobe," I said. "It looks out of place with the rest of
      the furniture. Why don't you have it removed?"</p>
      <div style="float:left; width: 50%;">
        <p class="figure"><a href="images/011-1.jpg"><img width="100%"
        src="images/011-1.jpg" alt="" /></a><br />
         "DON'T GO NEAR IT&mdash;I DREAD IT!"</p>
      </div>
      <p>"Hush," he said, with a gasp. "Don't go near it&mdash;I dread it, I have locked
      it. It is always in that direction that the apparition appears. The apparition
      seems to grow out of the glass of the wardrobe. It always appears in that one
      spot."</p>
      <p>"I see," I answered. "The wardrobe is built into the wall. That is the reason it
      cannot be removed. Have you got the key about you?"</p>
      <p>He fumbled in his pocket, and presently produced a bunch of keys.</p>
      <p>"I wish you wouldn't open the wardrobe," he said. "I frankly admit that I
      dislike having it touched."</p>
      <p>"All right," I replied. "I will not examine it while you are in the room. You
      will perhaps allow me to keep the key?"</p>
      <p>"Certainly! You can take it from the bunch, if you wish. This is it. I shall be
      only too glad to have it well out of my own keeping."</p>
      <p>"We will go downstairs," I said.</p>
      <p>We returned to Sir Henry's library. It was my turn now to lock the door.</p>
      <p>"Why do you do that?" he asked.</p>
      <p>"Because I wish to be quite certain that no one overhears our conversation."</p>
      <p>"What have you got to say?"</p>
      <p>"I have a plan to propose to you."</p>
      <p>"What is it?"</p>
      <p>"I want you to change bedrooms with me to-night."</p>
      <p>"What can you mean?&mdash;what will Lady Studley say?"</p>
      <p>"Lady Studley must know nothing whatever about the arrangement. I think it very
      likely that the apparition which troubles you will be discovered to have a material
      foundation. In short, I am determined to get to the bottom of this horror. You have
      seen it often, and your nerves are much shattered. I have never seen it, and my
      nerves are, I think, in tolerable order. If I sleep in your room
      to-night&mdash;"</p>
      <p>"It may not visit you."</p>
      <p>"It may not, but on the other hand it may. I have a curiosity to lie on that bed
      and to face that wardrobe in the wall. You must yield to my wishes, Sir Henry."</p>
      <p>"But how can the knowledge of this arrangement be kept from my wife?"</p>
      <p>"Easily enough. You will both go to your rooms as usual. You will bid her
      good-night as usual, and after the doors of communication are closed I will enter
      the room and you will go to mine, or to any other that you like to occupy. You say
      your wife never comes into your room during the hours of the night?"</p>
      <p>"She has never yet done so."</p>
      <p>"She will not to-night. Should she by any chance call for assistance, I will
      immediately summon you."</p>
      <p>It was very evident that Sir Henry did not like this arrangement. He yielded,
      however, to my very strong persuasions, which almost took the form of commands, for
      I saw that I could do nothing unless I got complete mastery over the man.</p>
      <p>Lady Studley returned from her drive just as our arrangements were fully made. I
      had not a moment during all the day to examine the interior of the wardrobe. The
      sick woman's restlessness grew greater as the hours advanced. She did not care to
      leave her husband's side. She sat with him as he examined his books. She followed
      him from room to room. In the afternoon, to the relief of everyone, some fresh
      guests arrived. In consequence we had a cheerful evening. Lady Studley came down to
      dinner in white from top to toe. Her dress was ethereal in texture and largely
      composed of lace. I cannot describe woman's dress, but with her shadowy figure and
      worn, but still lovely face, she looked spiritual. The gleam in her large blue eyes
      was pathetic. Her love for her husband was touching to behold. How soon, how very
      soon, they must part from each other! Only I as a doctor knew how impossible it was
      to keep the lamp of life much longer burning in the poor girl's frame.</p>
      <p>We retired as usual to rest. Sir Henry bade me a cheerful good-night. Lady
      Studley nodded to me as she left the room.</p>

         "'SLEEP WELL,' SHE SAID, IN A GAY VOICE."</p>
      </div>
      <p>"Sleep well," she said, in a gay voice.</p>
      <p>It was late the next morning when we all met round the breakfast table. Sir
      Henry looked better, but Lady Studley many degrees worse, than the night before. I
      wondered at her courage in retaining her post at the head of her table. The
      visitors, who came in at intervals and took their seats at the table, looked at her
      with wonder and compassion.</p>
      <p>"Surely my hostess is very ill?" said a guest who sat next my side.</p>
      <p>"Yes, but take no notice of it," I answered.</p>
      <p>Soon after breakfast I sought Sir Henry.</p>
      <p>"Well&mdash;well?" he said, as he grasped my hand. "Halifax, you have seen it. I
      know you have by the expression of your face."</p>
      <p>"Yes," I replied, "I have."</p>
      <p>"How quietly you speak. Has not the horror of the thing seized you?"</p>
      <p>"No," I said, with a brief laugh. "I told you yesterday that my nerves were in
      tolerable order. I think my surmise was correct, and that the apparition has
      tangible form and can be traced to its foundation."</p>
      <p>An unbelieving look swept over Sir Henry's face.</p>
      <p>"Ah," he said, "doctors are very hard to convince. Everything must be brought
      down to a cold material level to satisfy them; but several nights in that room
      would shatter even your nerves, my friend."</p>
      <p>"You are quite right," I answered. "I should be very sorry to spend several
      nights in that room. Now I will tell you briefly what occurred."</p>
      <p>We were standing in the library. Sir Henry went to the door, locked it, and put
      the key in his pocket.</p>
      <p>"Can I come in?" said a voice outside.</p>
      <p>The voice was Lady Studley's.</p>
      <p>"In a minute, my darling," answered her husband. "I am engaged with Halifax just
      at present."</p>
      <p>"Medically, I suppose?" she answered.</p>
      <p>"Yes, medically," he responded.</p>
      <p>She went away at once, and Sir Henry returned to my side.</p>
      <p>"Now speak," he said. "Be quick. She is sure to return, and I don't like her to
      fancy that we are talking secrets."</p>
      <p>"This is my story," I said. "I went into your room, put out all the lights, and
      sat on the edge of the bed."</p>
      <p>"You did not get into bed, then?"</p>
      <p>"No, I preferred to be up and to be ready for immediate action should the
      apparition, the horror, or whatever you call it, appear."</p>
      <p>"Good God, it is a horror, Halifax!"</p>
      <p>"It is, Sir Henry. A more diabolical contrivance for frightening a man into his
      grave could scarcely have been contrived. I can comfort you on one point, however.
      The terrible thing you saw is not a figment of your brain. There is no likelihood
      of a lunatic asylum in your case. Someone is playing you a trick."</p>
      <p>"I cannot agree with you&mdash;but proceed," said the baronet, impatiently.</p>
      <p>"I sat for about an hour on the edge of the bed," I continued. "When I entered
      the room it was twelve o'clock&mdash;one had sounded before there was the least
      stir or appearance of anything, then the ticking noise you have described was
      distinctly audible. This was followed by a sudden bright light, which seemed to
      proceed out of the recesses of the wardrobe."</p>
      <p>"What did you feel when you saw that light?"</p>
      <p>"Too excited to be nervous," I answered, briefly. "Out of the circle of light
      the horrible eye looked at me."</p>
      <p>"What did you do then? Did you faint?"</p>
      <p>"No, I went noiselessly across the carpet up to the door of the wardrobe and
      looked in."</p>
      <p>"Heavens! you are daring. I wonder you are alive to tell this tale."</p>
      <p>"I saw a shadowy form," I replied&mdash;"dark and tall&mdash;the one brilliant
      eye kept on looking past me, straight into the room. I made a very slight noise; it
      immediately disappeared. I waited for some time&mdash;nothing more happened. I got
      into your bed, Sir Henry, and slept. I can't say that I had a comfortable night,
      but I slept, and was not disturbed by anything extraordinary for the remaining
      hours of the night."</p>
      <p>"Now what do you mean to do? You say you can trace this thing to its foundation.
      It seems to me that all you have seen only supports my firm belief that a horrible
      apparition visits that room."</p>
      <p>"A material one," I responded. "The shadowy form had substance, of that I am
      convinced. Sir Henry, I intend to sleep in that room again to-night."</p>
      <p>"Lady Studley will find out."</p>
      <p>"She will not. I sleep in the haunted room again to-night, and during the day
      you must so contrive matters that I have plenty of time to examine the wardrobe. I
      did not do so yesterday because I had not an opportunity. You must contrive to get
      Lady Studley out of the way, either this morning or afternoon, and so manage
      matters for me that I can be some little time alone in your room."</p>
      <p>"Henry, Henry, how awestruck you look!" said a gay voice at the window. Lady
      Studley had come out, had come round to the library window, and, holding up her
      long, dark-blue velvet dress, was looking at us with a peculiar smile.</p>
      <p>"Well, my love," replied the baronet. He went to the window and flung it open.
      "Lucilla," he exclaimed, "you are mad to stand on the damp grass."</p>
      <p>"Oh, no, not mad," she answered. "I have come to that stage when nothing
      matters. Is not that so, Dr. Halifax?"</p>
      <p>"You are very imprudent," I replied.</p>
      <p>She shook her finger at me playfully, and turned to her husband.</p>
      <p>"Henry," she said, "have you taken my keys? I cannot find them anywhere."</p>
      <p>"I will go up and look for them," said Sir Henry. He left the room, and Lady
      Studley entered the library through one of the French windows.</p>
      <p>"What do you think of my husband this morning?" she asked.</p>
      <p>"He is a little better," I replied. "I am confident that he will soon be quite
      well again."</p>
      <p>She gave a deep sigh when I said this, her lips trembled, and she turned away. I
      thought my news would make her happy, and her depression surprised me.</p>
      <p>At this moment Sir Henry came into the room.</p>
      <p>"Here are your keys," he said to his wife. He gave her the same bunch he had
      given me the night before. I hoped she would not notice that the key of the
      wardrobe was missing.</p>
      <p>"And now I want you to come for a drive with me," said Sir Henry.</p>
      <p>He did not often accompany her, and the pleasure of this unlooked-for indulgence
      evidently tempted her.</p>
      <p>"Very well," she answered. "Is Dr. Halifax coming?"</p>
      <p>"No, he wants to have a ride."</p>
      <p>"If he rides, can he not follow the carriage?"</p>
      <p>"Will you do that, Halifax?" asked my host.</p>
      <p>"No, thank you," I answered; "I must write some letters before I go anywhere. I
      will ride to the nearest town and post them presently, if I may." I left the room
      as I spoke.</p>
      <p>Shortly afterwards I saw from a window Sir Henry and his wife drive away. They
      drove in a large open landau, and two girls who were staying in the house
      accompanied them. My hour had come, and I went up at once to Sir Henry's bedroom.
      Lady Studley's room opened directly into that of her husband, but both rooms had
      separate entrances.</p>
      <p>I locked the two outer doors now, and then began my investigations. I had the
      key of the wardrobe in my pocket.</p>
      <div style="float:right; width: 60%;">
        <p class="figure"><a href="images/014-1.jpg"><img width="100%"
        src="images/014-1.jpg" alt="" /></a><br />
         "GOOD HEAVENS! WHAT HAD HAPPENED?"</p>
      </div>
      <p>It was troublesome to unlock, because the key was a little rusty, and it was
      more than evident that the heavy doors had not been opened for some time. Both
      these doors were made of glass. When shut, they resembled in shape and appearance
      an ordinary old-fashioned window. The glass was set in deep mullions. It was thick,
      was of a peculiar shade of light blue, and was evidently of great antiquity. I
      opened the doors and went inside. The wardrobe was so roomy that I could stand
      upright with perfect comfort. It was empty, and was lined through and through with
      solid oak. I struck a light and began to examine the interior with care. After a
      great deal of patient investigation I came across a notch in the wood. I pressed my
      finger on this, and immediately a little panel slid back, which revealed underneath
      a small button. I turned the button and a door at the back of the wardrobe flew
      open. A flood of sunlight poured in, and stepping out, I found myself in another
      room. I looked around me in astonishment. This was a lady's chamber. Good heavens!
      what had happened? I was in Lady Studley's room. Shutting the mysterious door of
      the wardrobe very carefully, I found that all trace of its existence immediately
      vanished.</p>
      <p>There was no furniture against this part of the wall. It looked absolutely bare
      and smooth. No picture ornamented it. The light paper which covered it gave the
      appearance of a perfectly unbroken pattern. Of course, there must be a concealed
      spring somewhere, and I lost no time in feeling for it. I pressed my hand and the
      tips of my fingers in every direction along the wall. Try as I would, however, I
      could not find the spring, and I had at last to leave Lady Studley's room and go
      back to the one occupied by her husband, by the ordinary door.</p>
      <p>Once more I re-entered the wardrobe and deliberately broke off the button which
      opened the secret door from within. Anyone who now entered the wardrobe by this
      door, and shut it behind him, would find it impossible to retreat. The apparition,
      if it had material foundation, would thus find itself trapped in its own net.</p>
      <p>What could this thing portend?</p>
      <p>I had already convinced myself that if Sir Henry were the subject of a
      hallucination, I also shared it. As this was impossible, I felt certain that the
      apparition had a material foundation. Who was the person who glided night after
      night into Lady Studley's room, who knew the trick of the secret spring in the
      wall, who entered the old wardrobe, and performed this ghastly, this appalling
      trick on Sir Henry Studley? I resolved that I would say nothing to Sir Henry of my
      fresh discovery until after I had spent another night in the haunted room.</p>
      <p>Accordingly, I slipped the key of the wardrobe once more into my pocket and went
      downstairs.</p>
      <p>I had my way again that night. Once more I found myself the sole occupant of the
      haunted room. I put out the light, sat on the edge of the bed, and waited the issue
      of events. At first there was silence and complete darkness, but soon after one
      o'clock I heard the very slight but unmistakable tick-tick, which told me that the
      apparition was about to appear. The ticking noise resembled the quaint sound made
      by the death spider. There was no other noise of any sort, but a quickening of my
      pulses, a sensation which I could not call fear, but which was exciting to the
      point of pain, braced me up for an unusual and horrible sight. The light appeared
      in the dim recess of the wardrobe. It grew clear and steady, and quickly resolved
      itself into one intensely bright circle. Out of this circle the eye looked at me.
      The eye was unnaturally large&mdash;it was clear, almost transparent, its
      expression was full of menace and warning. Into the circle of light presently a
      shadowy and ethereal hand intruded itself. The fingers beckoned me to approach,
      while the eye looked fixedly at me. I sat motionless on the side of the bed. I am
      stoical by nature and my nerves are well seasoned, but I am not ashamed to say that
      I should be very sorry to be often subjected to that menace and that invitation.
      The look in that eye, the beckoning power in those long, shadowy fingers would soon
      work havoc even in the stoutest nerves. My heart beat uncomfortably fast, and I had
      to say over and over to myself, "This is nothing more than a ghastly trick." I had
      also to remind myself that I in my turn had prepared a trap for the apparition. The
      time while the eye looked and the hand beckoned might in reality have been counted
      by seconds; to me it seemed like eternity. I felt the cold dew on my forehead
      before the rapidly waning light assured me that the apparition was about to vanish.
      Making an effort I now left the bed and approached the wardrobe. I listened
      intently. For a moment there was perfect silence. Then a fumbling noise was
      distinctly audible. It was followed by a muffled cry, a crash, and a heavy fall. I
      struck a light instantly, and taking the key of the wardrobe from my pocket, opened
      it. Never shall I forget the sight that met my gaze.</p>
      <p>There, huddled up on the floor, lay the prostrate and unconscious form of Lady
      Studley. A black cloak in which she had wrapped herself partly covered her face,
      but I knew her by her long, fair hair. I pulled back the cloak, and saw that the
      unhappy girl had broken a blood-vessel, and even as I lifted her up I knew that she
      was in a dying condition.</p>
      <p>I carried her at once into her own room and laid her on the bed. I then returned
      and shut the wardrobe door, and slipped the key into my pocket. My next deed was to
      summon Sir Henry.</p>
      <p>"What is it?" he asked, springing upright in bed.</p>
      <p>"Come at once," I said, "your wife is very ill."</p>
      <p>"Dying?" he asked, in an agonized whisper.</p>
      <p>I nodded my head. I could not speak.</p>
      <p>My one effort now was to keep the knowledge of the ghastly discovery I had made
      from the unhappy husband.</p>
      <p>He followed me to his wife's room. He forgot even to question me about the
      apparition, so horrified was he at the sight which met his view.</p>
      <p>I administered restoratives to the dying woman, and did what I could to check
      the haemorrhage. After a time Lady Studley opened her dim eyes.</p>
      <p>"Oh, Henry!" she said, stretching out a feeble hand to him, "come with me, come
      with me. I am afraid to go alone."</p>
      <p>"My poor Lucilla," he said. He smoothed her cold forehead, and tried to comfort
      her by every means in his power.</p>
      <p>After a time he left the room. When he did so she beckoned me to approach. "I
      have failed," she said, in the most thrilling voice of horror I have ever listened
      to. "I must go alone. He will not come with me."</p>
      <p>"What do you mean?" I asked.</p>
      <p>She could scarcely speak, but at intervals the following words dropped slowly
      from her lips:&mdash;</p>
      <p>"I was the apparition. I did not want my husband to live after me. Perhaps I was
      a little insane. I cannot quite say. When I was told by Sir Joseph Dunbar that
      there was no hope of my life, a most appalling and frightful jealousy took
      possession of me. I pictured my husband with another wife. Stoop down."</p>
      <p>Her voice was very faint. I could scarcely hear her muttered words. Her eyes
      were glazing fast, death was claiming her, and yet hatred against some unknown
      person thrilled in her feeble voice.</p>
      <p>"Before my husband married me, he loved another woman," she continued. "That
      woman is now a widow. I felt certain that immediately after my death he would seek
      her out and marry her. I could not bear the thought&mdash;it possessed me day and
      night. That, and the terror of dying alone, worked such a havoc within me that I
      believe I was scarcely responsible for my own actions. A mad desire took possession
      of me to take my husband with me, and so to keep him from her, and also to have his
      company when I passed the barriers of life. I told you that my brother was a
      doctor. In his medical-student days the sort of trick I have been playing on Sir
      Henry was enacted by some of his fellow-students for his benefit, and almost scared
      him into fever. One day my brother described the trick to me, and I asked him to
      show me how it was done. I used a small electric lamp and a very strong
      reflector."</p>
      <p>"How did you find out the secret door of the wardrobe?" I asked.</p>
      <p>"Quite by chance. I was putting some dresses into the wardrobe one day and
      accidentally touched the secret panel. I saw at once that here was my
      opportunity."</p>
      <p>"You must have been alarmed at your success," I said, after a pause. "And now I
      have one more question to ask: Why did you summon me to the Grange?"</p>
      <p>She made a faint, impatient movement.</p>
      <p>"I wanted to be certain that my husband was really very ill," she said. "I
      wanted you to talk to him&mdash;I guessed he would confide in you; I thought it
      most probable that you would tell him that he was a victim of brain hallucinations.
      This would frighten him and would suit my purpose exactly. I also sent for you as a
      blind. I felt sure that under these circumstances neither you nor my husband could
      possibly suspect me."</p>
      <p>She was silent again, panting from exhaustion.</p>
      <p>"I have failed," she said, after a long pause. "You have discovered the truth.
      It never occurred to me for a moment that you would go into the room. He will
      recover now."</p>
      <p>She paused; a fresh attack of haemorrhage came on. Her breath came quickly. Her
      end was very near. Her dim eyes could scarcely see.</p>
      <p>Groping feebly with her hand she took mine.</p>
      <p>"Dr. Halifax&mdash;promise."</p>
      <p>"What?" I asked.</p>
      <p>"I have failed, but let me keep his love, what little love he has for me, before
      he marries that other woman. Promise that you will never tell him."</p>
      <p>"Rest easy," I answered, "I will never tell him."</p>
      <p>Sir Henry entered the room.</p>
      <p>I made way for him to kneel by his wife's side.</p>
      <p>As the grey morning broke Lady Studley died.</p>
      <p>Before my departure from the Grange I avoided Sir Henry as much as possible.
      Once he spoke of the apparition and asked if I had seen it. "Yes," I replied.</p>
      <p>Before I could say anything further, he continued:&mdash;</p>
      <p>"I know now why it came; it was to warn me of my unhappy wife's death." He said
      no more. I could not enlighten him, and he is unlikely now ever to learn the
      truth.</p>
      <p>The following day I left Studley Grange. I took with me, without asking leave of
      any-one, a certain long black cloak, a small electric lamp, and a magnifying glass
      of considerable power.</p>
      <p>It may be of interest to explain how Lady Studley in her unhealthy condition of
      mind and body performed the extraordinary trick by which she hoped to undermine her
      husband's health, and ultimately cause his death.</p>
      <p>I experimented with the materials which I carried away with me, and succeeded,
      so my friends told me, in producing a most ghastly effect.</p>
      <p>I did it in this way. I attached the mirror of a laryngoscope to my forehead in
      such a manner as to enable it to throw a strong reflection into one of my eyes. In
      the centre of the bright side of the laryngoscope a small electric lamp was fitted.
      This was connected with a battery which I carried in my hand. The battery was
      similar to those used by the ballet girls in Drury Lane Theatre, and could be
      brought into force by a touch and extinguished by the removal of the pressure. The
      eye which was thus brilliantly illumined looked through a lens of some power. All
      the rest of the face and figure was completely covered by the black cloak. Thus the
      brightest possible light was thrown on the magnified eye, while there was
      corresponding increased gloom around.</p>
      <p>When last I heard of Studley Grange it was let for a term of years and Sir Henry
      had gone abroad. I have not heard that he has married again, but he probably will,
      sooner or later.</p>

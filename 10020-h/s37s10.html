         NO. 1.&mdash;FAMILIAR "BOOK COVER" SIGNATURE.</p>
      </div>
      <p>"Everybody knows what Dickens's signature is like"&mdash;says the reader who
      bases acquaintance with it upon the familiar, gold-impressed facsimile on the
      well-known red covers of his works&mdash;"a free, dashing signature, with an
      extensive and well-graduated flourish underneath." (No. 1.)</p>
      <p>Aye! But have you ever seen an original Dickens-letter? Have you ever handled,
      not one, but hundreds of his documents&mdash;letters, franked envelopes, cheques
      signed by Dickens, cheques indorsed by him, legal agreements bearing his signature,
      and the original MSS. of his works? Owing to the kindness of owners and guardians
      of Dickens-letters, etc. I have been able to supplement the materials in my own
      collection by numerous facsimiles taken direct from a priceless store of
      Dickens-MSS. Here are some of the specimens. We will glance over them, and in doing
      so will view them, not merely as signatures, but also as permanently-recorded
      tracings of Dickens's nerve muscular action&mdash;of his <i>gesture</i>. The
      expressive play of his facial muscles has gone, the varying inflections of voice
      have gone, but we still possess the self-registered and characteristic tracings of
      Charles Dickens's hand-gesture.</p>

         NO. 2.&mdash;WRITTEN IN 1825.</p>
      </div>
      <p>In No. 1 we have the signature of Dickens as he wrote it when aged forty-five to
      fifty; in No. 2 there is the boy's signature at the age of thirteen, written to a
      school-fellow. This youthful signature shows the existence in embryo form of the
      "flourish" so commonly associated with Dickens's signature. It is interesting to
      note that the receiver of this early letter has stated that its schoolboy writer
      had "more than usual flow of spirits, held his head more erect than lads ordinarily
      do," and that "there was a general smartness about him." We shall perhaps see that
      the direct emphasis of so many of Charles Dickens's signatures which is given by
      his "flourish" may be fitly associated with certain characteristics of the man
      himself. We may also note that high spirits and vigorous nervous energy are
      productive of redundant nerve-muscular activity in any direction&mdash;hand gesture
      included.</p>

        &nbsp;
      </div>
      <p>Let us look at some other early signatures. Hitherto they have been stowed away
      in various collections, and they are almost unknown.</p>
      <div style="float:right; width:50%;">
        <p class="figure"><a href="images/080-3.png"><img width="100%"
        src="images/080-3.png" alt="" /></a><br />
         NO. 3.&mdash;WRITTEN IN 1830.</p>
      </div>
      <p>The next facsimile, No. 3, is remarkable as being almost the only full signature
      out of hundreds I have seen which lacks the flourish; this specimen is also worth
      notice, owing to the "droop" of every word below the horizontal level from which
      each starts&mdash;a little piece of nerve-muscular evidence of mental or physical
      depression, which may be tested by anyone who cares to examine his own handwriting
      produced under conditions which diminish bodily vigour or mental
      <i>&eacute;lan</i>.</p>
      <div style="float:right; width:50%; clear:right;">
        <p class="figure"><a href="images/081-1.png"><img width="100%"
        src="images/081-1.png" alt="" /></a><br />
         NO. 4.&mdash;WRITTEN IN 1831.</p>
      </div>
      <p>The writing of No. 4 is very like that of No. 3; the easy curves below the
      signature are cleverly made, and while they indicate much energy, they also point
      to a useful confidence in self, owing to the deliberate way of accentuating the
      most personal part of a letter&mdash;its signature.</p>
      <div style="float:right; width:50%; clear:right;">
        <p class="figure"><a href="images/081-2.png"><img width="100%"
        src="images/081-2.png" alt="" /></a><br />
         NO. 5.&mdash;WRITTEN IN 1832.</p>
      </div>
      <p>No. 5 is the facsimile of a signature to a letter which was written in the
      Library of the British Museum to "My dear Knolle"; the letter ends: "Believe me (in
      haste), yours most truly." At this time&mdash;1832&mdash;Dickens was a newspaper
      reporter, and it is curious to notice that in spite of "haste" he yet managed to
      execute this complex movement underneath the signature. Its force and energy are
      great, but we shall see even more pronounced developments of this flourish before
      it takes the moderated and graceful form of confident and assured power.</p>
      <div style="float:right; width:70%; clear:right;">
        <p class="figure"><a href="images/081-3.png"><img width="100%"
        src="images/081-3.png" alt="" /></a><br />
         NO. 6.&mdash;WRITTEN IN 1833 OR 1834.</p>
      </div>
      <p>There is still more force and "go" about No. 6: it was written on "Wednesday
      night, past 12," and also in haste. Dickens was reporting for the <i>Morning
      Chronicle</i>, and was just starting on a journey, but yet there are here two
      separate flourishes; one begins under the <i>s</i> of <i>Charles</i> and ends under
      the <i>C</i> of that name; the other starts under the capital <i>D</i> and finishes
      below the <i>n</i> of <i>Dickens</i>.</p>
      <div style="float:right; width:50%; clear:right;">
        <p class="figure"><a href="images/081-4.png"><img width="100%"
        src="images/081-4.png" alt="" /></a><br />
         NO. 7.&mdash;WRITTEN IN 1836.</p>
      </div>
      <div style="float:right; width:50%; clear:right;">
        <p class="figure"><a href="images/081-5.png"><img width="100%"
        src="images/081-5.png" alt="" /></a><br />
         NO. 8.&mdash;WRITTEN OCT. 1, 1836.</p>
      </div>
      <p>The intricacy of the next facsimile, No. 7, is an ugly but a very active piece
      of movement. This group of curves is equal to about a two-feet length of
      pen-stroke, a fact which indicates an extraordinary amount of personal energy.
      Dickens was then writing his "Sketches by Boz," and this ungraceful elaboration of
      his signature was probably accompanied by a growing sense of his own capacity and
      power. During the time-interval between the signatures shown in Nos. 7 and 8, the
      first number of the "Pickwick Papers" was published&mdash;March, 1836&mdash;and
      Charles Dickens married Catherine Hogarth on the 2nd of April in that year. The
      original of a very different facsimile (No. 9) was written as a receipt in the
      account-book of Messrs. Chapman and Hall for an advance of &pound;5.</p>
      <div style="float:left; width:80%; clear:right;">

         NO. 9.&mdash;WRITTEN IN 1837.</p>
      </div>
      <p>The six facsimiles numbered 9 to 15 deserve special notice. The originals were
      all written in the year 1837, and I have purposely shown them because their
      extraordinary variations entirely negative the popular idea about the uniformity of
      Dickens's handwriting, and because these mobile hand-gestures are a striking
      illustration of the mobility and great sensibility to impressions which were
      prominent features in Charles Dickens's nature.</p>

         NO. 11.&mdash;WRITTEN NOV. 3, 1837.</p>
      </div>
      <p>Common observation show us that a man whose mind is specially receptive of
      impressions from persons and things around him, and whose sensibility is very
      quick, can scarcely fail to show much variation in his own forms of outward
      expression&mdash;such, for example, as facial "play," voice-inflections,
      hand-gestures, and so on. Notice the originality in the position of the flourishes
      shown in No. 9, and compare the ungraceful movement of it with the much more
      dignified and pleasing flourishes in some of the later signatures. A whimsical
      originality of mind comes out also in the curious "B" of "Boz" (No. 10).</p>

         NO. 12.&mdash;WRITTEN NOV. 3, 1837.</p>
      </div>
      <p>The next pair&mdash;Nos. 11 and 12&mdash;are interesting. No. 11 shows the
      signature squeezed in at the bottom of a page; the flourish was attempted, and
      accompanied by the words: "No room for the flouish," the <i>r</i> of
      <i>flourish</i> being omitted. No. 12 was written on the envelope of the same
      letter.</p>

         <i>From a Portrait-Bust by H. Dexter.</i></p>
      </div>
      <p>No. 13 is a copy of a very famous signature: the original is on a great
      parchment called "Deed of License Assignment and Covenants respecting a Work called
      'The Pickwick Papers,'" and which, after a preamble, contains the words: "Whereas
      the said Charles Dickens is the Author of a Book or Work intituled 'The Posthumous
      Papers of the Pickwick Club,' which has been recently printed and published in
      twenty parts or numbers," etc. It is probable that the fact of the seal being
      placed between <i>Charles</i> and <i>Dickens</i> prevented the flourish which
      almost invariably accompanied his signatures on business documents; the marked
      enlargement of this signature takes the place of the flourish, and shows an
      unconscious emphasis of the <i>ego</i>. It would be almost unreasonable for us to
      expect that so impressionable a man, who was also feeling his power and fame, could
      abstain from showing outward signs of his own consciousness of abnormal success.
      Yet, in the private letters of Dickens, the simple "C. D." is very frequent; a few
      examples of it are given in this article, and their present number in no way
      represents the numerical relation of these simple signatures to the more "showy"
      ones. It may at once be said that this point of difference is alike interesting to
      the student of gesture and to the student of Dickens's character. He was certainly
      a very able man of business, and the wording of his "business" letters fully bears
      out the idea conveyed by his "business" signature&mdash;so to speak&mdash;that
      Dickens was fully aware of his own powers, and that, quite fairly, he did not omit
      to impress the fact upon other people when he thought fit. Both the wording and the
      signature of many of his private letters are simple and unostentatious to a high
      degree. This curious fact, which is now illustrated by Charles Dickens's own
      hand-gesture, ought to be remembered when people talk about Dickens's "conceit" and
      "love of show." My explanation is, I think, both logical and true.</p>

       <i>(Announcing the Death of "Raven", a prominent character in "Barnaby

      <p>No. 15 shows part of a very humorous and famous letter announcing the death of
      the raven which figures in "Barnaby Rudge." Notice the curious originality of form
      shown in the capital <i>Y</i> and <i>R</i>. The wording of this letter is also
      quaintly original, and the sensitive mind of this man again caused his
      nerve-muscular action&mdash;his gesture&mdash;to harmonize with his mood. Points of
      this kind, which the handwriting of Dickens illustrates so well, have a deeper
      meaning for the observant than for the casual reader of a magazine article; they
      indicate that these little human acts, which have been so long overlooked by
      intelligent men, do really give us valuable data for the study of mind by means of
      written-gesture.</p>

      <p>When on a reading tour, Dickens wrote at Bideford the letter from which No. 23
      has been copied. After writing that he could get nothing to eat or drink at the
      small inn, he wrote the sentence facsimiled. The exaggeration of the words is
      matched by the use of two capital <i>T</i>'s in place of two small <i>t</i>'s. The
      letter continues: "The landlady is playing cribbage with the landlord in the next
      room (behind a thin partition), and they seem quite comfortable." No. 24 is another
      instance of the variation which, in fact, obtained up to the very day before death.
      No. 25 was written at Berwick-on-Tweed; it is an amusing letter, and states how the
      local agents wanted to put the famous reader into "a little lofty crow's nest," and
      how "I instantly struck, of course, and said I would either read in a room attached
      to this house ... or not at all. Terrified local agents glowered, but fell
      prostrate." By the way, notice, in No. 25, the emphasis of gesture on the
      <i>me</i>.</p>

      <p>No. 26 is written in one continuous stroke with a noticeably good management of

      <p>But we near the end. Doctors had detected the signs of breaking up, which are
      not less plain in the written gesture, and had strenuously urged Dickens to stop
      the incessant strain caused by his public readings. The stimulus of facing an
      appreciative audience would spur him on time after time, and then, late at night,
      he would write affectionate letters giving details of "the house," etc., but which
      are painful to see if one notices the constant droop of the words and of the lines
      across the page. Contrast the writing in No. 28, broken and agitated, with some of
      the earlier specimens I have shown you. This was written three days before death.
      The wording of the letter from which No. 29 has been copied tells no tale of
      weakness, but the gesture which clothes the words is tell-tale. The words, and the
      lines of words, run downward across the paper, and No. 29 is very suggestive of
      serious trouble&mdash;and it is specially suggestive to those who have studied this
      form of gesture: look, for example, at the ill-managed flourish.</p>

       <i>From the last letter written by Charles Dickens.</i></p>
      <p>Now comes a facsimile taken from the last letter written by Charles Dickens. It
      has been given elsewhere, but, not satisfied with the facsimile I saw, I obtained
      permission to take this direct from the letter in the British Museum. This was
      written an hour or so before the fatal seizure. Every word droops below the level
      from which each starts, each line of writing descends across the page, the simple
      <i>C. D.</i> is very shaky, and the whole letter is broken and weak. Charles
      Dickens was not "ready" at "3 o'clock"&mdash;he died at ten minutes past six p.m.
      And so ends this too scanty notice of a great man's written-gesture.</p>
      <hr />
      <p class="footnote">NOTE:&mdash;Considerations of space and of the avoidance of
      technicalities have prevented a really full account of the written gesture of
      Charles Dickens; scanty as the foregoing account is, the illustrations it contains
      could not have been supplied by any one collector of Charles Dickens's letters. I
      express my sincere gratitude to the many persons who have enabled me to give these
      illustrations, and only regret that one collector refused my request for the loan
      of some very early and interesting letters.</p>

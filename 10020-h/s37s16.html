      <p>Uffizzi Robbinson was blessed with a very full rich, tenor voice but a very
      empty purse and he stood in need of a HOLIDAY.</p>
      <p>So he cut his hair &amp; otherwise disguised himself &amp; went off to Brighton,
      and having hired a piano &amp; boy took up his station on the front and started in
      to make his fortune.</p>
      <p>He sang song after song, all of them highly classical, in his most approved
      style, but his audience being limited and critical, his prospects looked
      gloomy.</p>
      <p>A gentle hint from his boy set him thinking!! He DISAPPEARED!!! A shadow on the
      blind gave the only indication of what he was doing!!</p>
      <p>Until one evening he reappeared on the front in all the glories of collar &amp;
      banjo, sang vulgar comic songs in a vulgar comic manner to a vast and appreciative
      audience and lived in clover for the rest of the season.</p>

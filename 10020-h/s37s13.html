      <h4>I.</h4>
      <p>One afternoon, Mons. Sauvallier received from his younger son&mdash;a
      lieutenant in garrison at Versailles&mdash;the following letter:</p>
      <p>"Versailles, May 25, 1883.</p>
      <p>"MY DEAR FATHER,</p>
      <p>"A terrible catastrophe has befallen me, one which will be a blow to you also. I
      am writing about it, because I dare not face you; I deserve never to see you
      again!</p>
      <p>"Led astray by a companion, I have been gambling on the Bourse, and am involved
      in yesterday's crash, in which so many fortunes have been suddenly swamped.</p>
      <p>"I scarcely dare to tell you how much I have lost. Yet I <i>must</i> do so, for
      the honour of the Sauvalliers is concerned. Alas! you will be all but ruined!</p>
      <p>"I owe the sum of four hundred and sixty-eight thousand francs. Oh! what a
      miserable wretch I am!</p>
      <p>"When I found that the smash was inevitable I went mad, and entered my room with
      the intention of putting an end to my wretched existence. But more sober thoughts
      prevailed: I changed my mind. I had heard that officers were being recruited for
      Tonquin, and I determined to volunteer for this service. My suicide would not have
      bettered matters; it would rather have left an added blot upon our family name. Out
      there, at all events, my death may be of use; it will cause you no shame, and may
      perhaps move you to a little compassion for your guilty, but most unhappy and
      despairing son, who suffers agonies at thought of the trouble he has brought upon
      you, and who now bids you an eternal farewell!</p>
      <p>"CAMILLE SAUVALLIER."</p>
      <p>Mons. Sauvallier, who had been a widower for several years past, was one of the
      most respected business-men of Paris, the owner of a foundry, a judge of the
      Tribunal of Commerce, and an officer of the Legion of Honour. He had two sons:
      Camille, the lieutenant: and August, an artist of some originality, who was the
      husband of a charming wife, and the father of a little six-year-old maiden named
      Andr&eacute;e. Mons. Sauvallier had always deterred his sons from embarking in
      trade. He had shrunk from exposing them to the ups and downs of business life, its
      trying fluctuations, its frequent cruel mischances. He had arranged that at his
      death his estate should be realized: he did not wish the business to be sold
      outright, in case it should pass into the hands of strangers who might sully the
      hitherto unblemished name of Sauvallier.</p>
      <p>And now, in spite of all his precautions, a disaster greater than any he had
      dreamed of had overwhelmed him.</p>
      <div style="float:left; width:60%;">
        <p class="figure"><a href="images/100-1.png"><img width="100%"
        src="images/100-1.png" alt="" /></a><br />
         "HE ROSE WITH DIFFICULTY."</p>
      </div>
      <p>Leaning back wearily in his arm-chair, with haggard eyes he re-read his son's
      letter, in order to assure himself that he was not dreaming. Yes! It was too true!
      Camille had ruined, perhaps dishonoured, him! It seemed as though the objects that
      surrounded him&mdash;the very walls and furniture&mdash;were no longer the same! As
      one staggering beneath a too heavy burden, he rose with difficulty, his limbs
      stiff, yet his whole frame agitated; then he sank back into his chair, with two big
      tears flowing down his cheeks.</p>
      <p>By hook or by crook he <i>must</i> procure the sum, and the debt should be paid
      to-morrow. It would be a difficult task. The wealth of the manufacturer consists of
      material and merchandise. Would so hurried a realization yield the necessary
      amount? He could not tell. Again, when this debt was paid, would he be able to
      fulfil his engagements? Bankruptcy stared him in the face. A Sauvallier bankrupt?
      An officer of the Legion of Honour, a judge of the Tribunal of Commerce, insolvent?
      Never! He would die first!</p>
      <p>But before it came to that, he would try every expedient: he would strain every
      nerve.</p>
      <p>So all night long the poor man planned and calculated, and in the morning, with
      heavy heart, proceeded to put his plans into effect.</p>
      <p>He visited his numerous friends and told them of his trouble, which elicited
      much sympathy. In order to help, some made large purchases of him, paying ready
      money, others advanced or lent him money. All day until the evening he was running
      about Paris collecting cheques, bank-notes, and orders.</p>
      <p class="figure"><a href="images/101-1.png"><img width="90%"
      src="images/101-1.png" alt="" /></a><br />
       "HE NOW BROUGHT THE SUM THUS GAINED."</p>
      <p>In the evening, as he sat down to ascertain the result of the day's efforts.
      Auguste came in with his wife and Andr&eacute;e. To help his father, the artist had
      parted with some of his pictures at a sacrifice, and he now brought the sum thus
      gained.</p>
      <p>Andr&eacute;e, unconscious of the trouble of her elders, began to play with her
      "J&eacute;anne," a doll nearly as big as herself, which her grandfather had given
      her some time previously, and which she loved, she said, "as her own daughter."</p>
      <p>But the child soon observed the sadness of her parents and her dear grandfather,
      and she looked with earnest, inquiring gaze from one to the other, trying to
      discover what was amiss. She saw her father lay down his pocket-book, she watched
      her mother place upon the table her bracelets, necklaces, ear-rings, and rings,
      while Mons. Sauvallier thanked them with tears in his eyes. With a very thoughtful,
      serious expression on her little face, the child turned towards her doll, embraced
      it with the emotional fervour of a last adieu, then carried it to her grandfather,
      saying, in sweet, resigned tones: "Take it, grandpapa! You can sell her, too."</p>
      <p>Mons. Sauvallier wept upon the neck of his little granddaughter, murmuring, "You
      also, my angel? Oh, that miserable boy!"</p>
      <h4>II.</h4>
      <p>Thus Camille's debt was paid, and the honour of the Sauvalliers was saved. But
      the father's fortune had gone!</p>
      <p>He was able, however, to retain his business. He said to himself that he must
      work still, in spite of his threescore years; that he must labour incessantly, with
      the anxious ardour of those beginning life with nothing to rely upon save their own
      exertions.</p>
      <p>He reduced his expenses, gave up his own house and went to live with his son,
      sold his carriage and horses, discharged his servants, and stinted himself in every
      possible way. Auguste became his designer, Auguste's wife his clerk. Each accepted
      his or her share of the burden bravely and uncomplainingly, as an important duty
      which must at any cost be accomplished.</p>
      <p>The conduct of this old man, so jealous for his name, so upright, so courageous
      in misfortune, excited profound sympathy. All who knew him pitied him; orders
      flowed in, and soon a quite exceptional activity pervaded the establishment from
      basement to roof, inspiring Mons. Sauvallier with a little hope. But one persistent
      fear disturbed his sleep, and troubled his waking hours. It was that some day he
      might hear that Camille had been gambling again, and was once more in debt. He had
      forbidden all mention of his erring son, but the thought of him was ever present,
      and lay like an incubus upon his heart.</p>
      <p>One year passed, then another. The foundry still flourished; work positively
      raged therein. It had no rest; it also, as though endowed with a conscience, did
      its duty nobly. Its furnaces glowed like ardent eyes; its mighty puffing and
      snorting shook the ground: the molten metal, red and fuming, flowed from its
      crucibles like blood from its body. At an early hour of the morning was heard its
      piercing summons to the work-people, and all the night long its glare illuminated
      the sky.</p>
      <h4>III.</h4>
      <p>The campaign of Tonquin was in full swing. In the midst of an unknown country,
      harassed by innumerable difficulties, the French soldiers were contending painfully
      with an irrepressible, ever-rallying foe. The smallest success served to excite the
      popular patriotism, and all awaited impatiently the tidings of a decisive
      victory.</p>
      <p>One morning, Auguste, looking very pale, entered his father's office, and handed
      him a newspaper. There, amongst "Latest intelligence," Mons. Sauvallier read the
      following:&mdash;</p>
      <p class="figure"><a href="images/102-1.jpg"><img width="90%"
      src="images/102-1.jpg" alt="" /></a><br />
       "LEADING THEM ON TO THE ASSAULT."</p>
      <p>"From the camp entrenched at Dong-Song. February 12th, 1885.&mdash;To-day,
      Captain Sauvallier attacked the enemy with extreme vigour, fought all the day
      against considerable forces, and captured successively three redoubts. In attacking
      the last of the three, his soldiers, overpowered by numbers, were about to retreat;
      but, although seriously wounded in the head and thigh, the gallant officer, borne
      by two men, succeeded in rallying his company and leading them on to the assault.
      His conduct was admirable, but his condition is hopeless. I have attached the cross
      to his breast. This brilliant feat of arms will enable me to enter Lang-Son
      tomorrow.&mdash;GENERAL BRIERE DE L'ISLE."</p>
      <p>Upon reading these words, Mons. Sauvallier felt a strange emotion, in which
      anguish mingled with joy. For a moment he was silent; then he said to his son, "You
      think that it is he? He is, then, a captain?"</p>
      <p>He read the despatch again, then murmured softly: "The cross! Condition
      hopeless!" And a tear rolled down his cheek.</p>
      <p>Two hours later the family received a formal intimation of Camille's deed and
      state from the Minister of War, and on the following day all the journals were
      praising Captain Sauvallier, son of the respected founder, of Grenelle. And now
      they gave details. Camille, it appeared, had been nominated captain a few months
      back. Throughout the campaign he had distinguished himself by his imperturbable
      coolness under fire, and reckless scorn of the death which he seemed to seek.</p>
      <p>His act of heroic energy stirred the enthusiasm of Press and populace, and the
      name of Sauvallier was on every lip. Camille's portrait appeared in the
      shop-windows; the illustrated journals depicted him before the redoubt, carried
      upon the shoulders of two men, his sword pointed towards the enemy, encouraging his
      soldiers by his voice, gesture, and look, his forehead bound with a handkerchief,
      and his face bleeding.</p>
      <p>Mons. Sauvallier could not go out of doors without seeing his son's presentment.
      From the news-stalls of the boulevards, the corners of the streets, the publishers'
      shop-fronts, a ubiquitous Camille watched him pass, and seemed to follow him with
      his eyes. Almost at each step the father received congratulations, while
      complimentary letters and cards covered his table to overflowing. But, alas! the
      telegrams which he received daily from Tonquin left him little hope that he should
      ever again behold in the flesh this dear son, of whom now he was so proud.</p>
      <div style="float:left; width:50%;">
        <p class="figure"><a href="images/103-1.jpg"><img width="100%"
        src="images/103-1.jpg" alt="" /></a><br />
         "HERE HE IS!"</p>
      </div>
      <p>One morning, three months later, Mons. Sauvallier was at work in his office,
      when the door opened softly, and disclosed Andr&eacute;e's curly head. The little
      one seemed in high spirits, her eyes sparkled with glee. "See, grandfather, here he
      is!" she said, and led into the room Captain Sauvallier.</p>
      <p>Auguste and his wife followed the pair. Mons. Sauvallier, taken completely by
      surprise, rose quickly from his chair, then stood motionless, overcome by his
      emotion. He saw before him Camille, with the scar upon his forehead, and the cross
      upon his breast&mdash;Camille, the hero of the hour, who had shed such lustre upon
      the family name!</p>
      <p>Timid and embarrassed, like a child who has been guilty of a fault, Camille
      stood with bowed head, and when he saw how much his father had aged, he knew that
      it was his conduct which had wrought the sad change, and his contrition was
      deepened tenfold.</p>
      <p>But as he was about to throw himself at his father's feet, Mons. Sauvallier,
      with a sudden movement, clasped him to his breast, exclaiming, in a voice full of
      tears, "No, Camille! in my arms! in my arms!"</p>
      <p>Father and son, locked together in closest embrace, mingled their sobs, while
      Auguste and his wife, looking on, wept in sympathy.</p>
      <p>The silence was broken by Andr&eacute;e. The child had vanished for a moment,
      but speedily reappeared, fondling her precious doll, which, it is needless to say,
      had not been sold. Holding it out to the captain, she said in her liveliest manner:
      "Here is Jeanne, uncle! You remember her? Give her a kiss directly! Don't you think
      that she has grown?"</p>
